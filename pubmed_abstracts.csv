2020-03-01,"Emerging evidence suggests that the mechanical behavior of the brain plays a critical role in development, disease, and aging. Recent studies have begun to characterize the mechanical behavior of gray and white matter tissue and to identify sets of material models that best reproduce the stress-strain behavior of different brain regions. Yet, these models are mainly phenomenological in nature, their parameters often lack clear physical interpretation, and they fail to correlate the mechanical behavior to the underlying microstructural composition. Here we make a first attempt towards identifying general relations between microstructure and mechanics with the ultimate goal to develop microstructurally motivated constitutive equations for human brain tissue. Using histological staining, we analyze the microstructure of brain specimens from different anatomical regions, the cortex, basal ganglia, corona radiata, and corpus callosum, and identify the regional stiffness and viscosity under multiple loading conditions, simple shear, compression, and tension. Strikingly, our study reveals a negative correlation between cell count and stiffness, a positive correlation between myelin content and stiffness, and a negative correlation between proteoglycan content and stiffness. Additionally, our analysis shows a positive correlation between lipid and proteoglycan content and viscosity. We demonstrate how understanding the microstructural origin of the macroscopic behavior of the brain can help us design microstructure-informed material models for human brain tissue that inherently capture regional heterogeneities. This study represents an important step towards using brain tissue stiffness and viscosity as early diagnostic markers for clinical conditions including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, or multiple sclerosis. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The complex and heterogeneous mechanical properties of brain tissue play a critical role for brain function. To understand and predict how brain tissue properties vary in space and time, it will be key to link the mechanical behavior to the underlying microstructural composition. Here we use histological staining to quantify area fractions of microstructural components of mechanically tested specimens and evaluate their individual contributions to the nonlinear macroscopic mechanical response. We further propose a microstructure-informed material model for human brain tissue that inherently captures regional heterogeneities. The current work provides unprecedented insights into the biomechanics of human brain tissue, which are highly relevant to develop refined computational models for brain tissue behavior or to advance neural tissue engineering.

2020-02-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) bear a complex relationship, potentially increasing risk of one another reciprocally. However, recent evidence suggests post-TBI dementia exists as a distinct neurodegenerative syndrome, confounding AD diagnostic accuracy in clinical settings. This investigation sought to evaluate TBI's impact on the accuracy of clinician-diagnosed AD using gold standard neuropathological criteria. In this preliminary analysis, data were acquired from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre (NACC), which aggregates clinical and neuropathologic information from Alzheimer's disease centres across the United States. Modified National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria were applied to confirm AD by neuropathology. Among participants with clinician-diagnosed AD, TBI history was associated with misdiagnosis (false positives) (OR = 1.351 [95% CI: 1.091-1.674],  "
2020-02-01,"Recent discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in former National Football League (NFL) players has led to a surge of papers investigating cognitive functioning in these former athletes. This critical review of the literature focused on the neuropsychological functioning in these ageing athletes, and included 22 articles published between 2013 and 2019, of which 13 reported on neuroradiological imaging and four focused on dose-response relationships of repetitive head injury on cognitive outcomes. Four studies suggest higher prevalence of MCI and neurodegenerative disease among NFL retirees, although a quantifiable risk and prevalence of cognitive impairment and dementia in these players remains unknown. Decreased verbal memory has been found in some players across multiple studies, though with unknown clinical significance due to small sample sizes, unreported effect sizes, and absence of longitudinal data. Studies investigating a dose-response relationship between cognitive decline and head injury have generated mixed findings utilizing various measures of head injury exposure. Neuroradiological findings are inconsistent, but suggest that some NFL players may be at greater risk for reduced white matter integrity. Future research is needed to understand the relationship between sports-related concussions and the risk of long-term cognitive decline and neurodegenerative disease in ageing NFL players. "
2020-02-01,"Repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) can lead to development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is characterized by progressive neurodegeneration with presence of white matter damage, gliosis and hyper-phosphorylated tau. While animal models of rmTBI have been documented, few characterize the molecular pathogenesis and expression profiles of relevant injured brain regions. Additionally, while the usage of transgenic tau mice in rmTBI is prevalent, the effects of tau on pathological outcomes has not been well studied. Here we characterized a 42-impact closed-head rmTBI paradigm on 3-4 month old male C57BL/6 (WT) and Tau-overexpressing mice (Tau58.4). This injury paradigm resulted in chronic gliosis, T-cell infiltration, and demyelination of the optic nerve and associated white matter tracts at 1-month post-injury. At 3-months post-injury, Tau58.4 mice showed progressive neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in multiple brain regions compared to WT mice. Corresponding to histopathology, RNAseq of the optic nerve tract at 1-month post-injury showed significant upregulation of inflammatory pathways and downregulation of myelin synthetic pathways in both genotypes. However, Tau58.4 mice showed additional changes in neurite development, protein processing, and cell stress. Comparisons with published transcriptomes of human Alzheimer's Disease and CTE revealed common signatures including neuroinflammation and downregulation of protein phosphatases. We next investigated the demyelination and T-cell infiltration phenotypes to determine whether these offer potential avenues for therapeutic intervention. Tau58.4 mice were treated with the histamine H3 receptor antagonist GSK239512 for 1-month post-injury to promote remyelination of white matter lesions. This restored myelin gene expression to sham levels but failed to repair the histopathologic lesions. Likewise, injured T-cell-deficient Rag2/Il2rg (R2G2) mice also showed evidence for inflammation and loss of myelin. However, unlike immune-competent mice, R2G2 mice had altered myeloid cell gene expression and fewer demyelinated lesions. Together this data shows that rmTBI leads to chronic white matter inflammatory demyelination and axonal loss exacerbated by human tau overexpression but suggests that immune-suppression and remyelination alone are insufficient to reverse damage.

2020-01-01,"Repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) impair cognitive abilities and increase risk of neurodegenerative disorders in humans. We developed two repetitive mild TBI models in rats with different time intervals between successive weight-drop injuries. Rats were subjected to repetitive Sham (no injury), single mild (mTBI), repetitive mild (rmTBI - 5 hits, 24 h apart), rapid repetitive mild (rapTBI - 5 hits, 5 min apart) or a single severe (sTBI) TBI. Cognitive performance was assessed 2 and 8 weeks after TBI in the novel object recognition test (NOR), and 6-7 weeks after TBI in the water maze (MWM). Acute immunohistochemical markers were evaluated 24 h after TBI, and blood biomarkers were measured with ELISA 8 weeks after TBI. In the NOR, both rmTBI and rapTBI showed poor performance at 2 weeks post-injury. At 8 weeks post-injury, the rmTBI group still performed worse than the Sham and mTBI groups, while the rapTBI group recovered. In the MWM, the rapTBI group performed worse than the Sham and mTBI groups. Acute APP and RMO-14 immunohistochemistry showed axonal injury at the pontomedullary junction in the sTBI, but not in other groups. ELISA showed increased serum GFAP levels 8 weeks after sTBI, while no differences were found between the injury groups in the levels of phosphorylated-tau and S100β. Results suggest that the rmTBI protocol is the most suitable model for testing cognitive impairment after mild repetitive head injuries and that the prolonged cognitive impairment after repetitive mild TBI originates from different structural and molecular mechanisms compared to similar impairments after single sTBI.

2020-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to contact and collision sports, including American football. We hypothesized a dose-response relationship between duration of football played and CTE risk and severity. In a convenience sample of 266 deceased American football players from the Veterans Affairs-Boston University-Concussion Legacy Foundation and Framingham Heart Study Brain Banks, we estimated the association of years of football played with CTE pathological status and severity. We evaluated the ability of years played to classify CTE status using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Simulation analyses quantified conditions that might lead to selection bias. In total, 223 of 266 participants met neuropathological diagnostic criteria for CTE. More years of football played were associated with having CTE (odds ratio [OR] = 1.30 per year played, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-1.41; p = 3.8 × 10 The odds of CTE double every 2.6 years of football played. After accounting for brain bank selection, the magnitude of the relationship between years played and CTE status remained consistent. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:116-131. "
2020-01-01,"Neuroinflammation is a characteristic pathological change of acute neurological deficit and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Microglia are the key cell involved in neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. The type of microglia polarization determines the direction of neuroinflammation. MiR-21-5p elevated in neurons and microglia after TBI in our previous research. In this study, we explore the influence of miR-21-5p for neuroinflammation by regulating microglia polarization. In this study, PC12 and BV2 used to instead of neuron and microglia respectively. The co-cultured transwell system used to simulate interaction of PC12 and BV2 cells in vivo environment. We found that PC12-derived exosomes with containing miR-21-5p were phagocytosed by microglia and induced microglia polarization, meanwhile, the expression of miR-21-5p was increased in M1 microglia cells. Polarization of M1 microglia aggravated the release of neuroinflammation factors, inhibited the neurite outgrowth, increased accumulation of P-tau and promoted the apoptosis of PC12 cells, which formed a model of cyclic cumulative damage. Simultaneously, we also got similar results in vivo experiments. PC12-derived exosomes with containing miR-21-5p is the essential of this cyclic cumulative damage model. Therefore, regulating the expression of miR-21-5p or the secretion of exosomes may be an important novel strategy for the treatment of neuroinflammation after TBI. "
2020-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a debilitating neurodegenerative disorder associated with repetitive traumatic brain injuries often sustained through prior contact sport participation. The frequency of this disorder in a diverse population, including amateur athletes, is unknown. Primary historical obituary and yearbook records were queried for 2566 autopsy cases in the Mayo Clinic Tissue Registry resulting in identification of 300 former athletes and 450 non-athletes. In these cases, neocortical tissue was screened for tau pathology with immunohistochemistry, including pathology consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, blinded to exposure or demographic information. Using research infrastructure of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a comprehensive and established medical records-linkage system of care providers in southern Minnesota and western Wisconsin, medical diagnostic billing codes pertaining to head trauma, dementia, movement disorders, substance abuse disorders and psychiatric disorders were recorded for cases and controls in a blinded manner. A total of 42 individuals had pathology consistent with, or features of, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It was more frequent in athletes compared to non-athletes (27 cases versus 15 cases) and was largely observed in men (except for one woman). For contact sports, American football had the highest frequency of chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathology (15% of cases) and an odds ratio of 2.62 (P-value = 0.005). Cases with chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathology had higher frequencies of antemortem clinical features of dementia, psychosis, movement disorders and alcohol abuse compared to cases without chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathology. Understanding the frequency of chronic traumatic encephalopathy pathology in a large autopsy cohort with diverse exposure backgrounds provides a baseline for future prospective studies assessing the epidemiology and public health impact of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and sports-related repetitive head trauma. "
2020-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by repetitive trauma to the central nervous system (CNS) suffered by soldiers, contact sport athletes, and civilians following accident-related trauma. CTE is a CNS tauopathy, with trauma-induced inflammation leading to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated forms of the microtubule-binding protein Tau (pTau), resulting in neurofibrillary tangles and progressive loss of neurons. At present, there are no therapies to treat CTE. We hypothesized that direct CNS administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector coding for an anti-pTau antibody would generate sufficient levels of anti-pTau in the CNS to suppress pTau accumulation thus interrupting the pathogenic process. Using a serotype AAVrh.10 gene transfer vector coding for a monoclonal antibody directed against pTau, we demonstrate the feasibility of this strategy in a murine CTE model in which pTau accumulation was elicited by repeated traumatic brain injury (TBI) using a closed cortical impact procedure over 5 days. Direct delivery of AAVrh.10 expression vectors coding for either of the two different anti-pTau antibodies to the hippocampus of these TBI mice significantly reduced pTau levels across the CNS. Using doses that can be safely scaled to humans, the data demonstrate that CNS administration of AAVrh.10anti-pTau is effective, providing a new strategy to interrupt the CTE consequences of TBI. "
2020-01-01,"Azure-A is one of the phenothiazines (PTZs) derivatives which for decades have been used as antipsychotic drugs due to good lipophilic characteristics which enable them to pass through the blood brain barrier (BBB), besides the important property of enabeling investigation of the pathological forms of aggregated tau protein found in the neurons of the central nervous system. Radioiodination of Azure-A was carried out via an electrophilic substitution reaction using chloramine-T as oxidizing agent. The influence of various reaction parameters and conditions on radioiodination efficiency was investigated, and a high radiochemical yield of 92.07 ± 0.9 % was obtained. An in vitro cytotoxicity study of iodinated Azure-A on three cell lines (HCT-116, human colon carcinoma cell line; Hep-G2, liver carcinoma cell line and HFB-4, normal human melanocytes) was carried out, and the data revealed that ioiodinated Azure A has no to very low toxic effect.

2020-01-01,"The misfolding and aggregation of tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles is the main underlying hallmark of tauopathies. Most tauopathies have a sporadic origin and can be associated with multiple risk factors. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been suggested as a risk factor for tauopathies by triggering disease onset and facilitating its progression. Several studies indicate that TBI seems to be a risk factor to development of Alzheimer disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, because there is a relationship of TBI severity and propensity to development of these illnesses. In this study, we evaluated whether moderate to severe TBI can trigger the initial formation of pathological tau that would induce the development of the pathology throughout the brain. To this end, we subjected tau transgenic mice to TBI and assessed tau phosphorylation and aggregation pattern to create a spatial heat map of tau deposition and spreading in the brain. Our results suggest that brain injured tau transgenic mice have an accelerated tau pathology in different brain regions that increases over time compared with sham mice. The appearance of pathological tau occurs in regions distant to the injury area that are connected synaptically, suggesting dissemination of tau aggregates. Overall, this work posits TBI as a risk factor for tauopathies through the induction of tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation. "
2020-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease process well-recognized in boxers, American football players and military personnel, is a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by repetitive blows to the head. Subjects with CTE can have a wide range of emotional, cognitive and physical symptoms. The cognitive group patients had a significantly higher probability of developing dementia in later years. Currently, there are no disease modifying regimen for CTE. Timely intervention of head blow could diminish the development of CTE. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is a common adjunct used to promote bone healing for fresh fracture. Recent reports suggest that LIPUS can noninvasively modulate the cortical function and have neuroprotective effect in various animal models of traumatic brain injury, stroke, Alzheimer's disease and major depressive disorder. The multifunctional mechanisms of LIPUS neuroprotective effect include several trophic factor stimulations, anti-inflammatory properties and reduction of brain edema. From the above evidence, LIPUS intervention could be a strategy for the prevention of the clinical CTE sequelae of repetitive head blows. We hypothesized that due to its neuroprotective effects, the non-invasive and easy-to-use method of LIPUS brain stimulation could have a preventive effect on players who have head blows during the match. The development of a time sensitive protocol, resembling the therapeutic algorithm for traumatic brain injury, would potentially prevent the development of subsequent CTE adverse outcome. Further long-term longitudinal studies of LIPUS stimulation are warranted to verify the prevention efficacy of this intervention for CTE. "
2020-01-01,"Autotaxin (ATX) is a soluble extracellular enzyme that is abundant in mammalian plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). It has two known enzymatic activities, acting as both a phosphodiesterase and a phospholipase. The majority of its biological effects have been associated with its ability to liberate lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) from its substrate, lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC). LPA has diverse pleiotropic effects in the central nervous system (CNS) and other tissues via the activation of a family of six cognate G protein-coupled receptors. These LPA receptors (LPARs) are expressed in some combination in all known cell types in the CNS where they mediate such fundamental cellular processes as proliferation, differentiation, migration, chronic inflammation, and cytoskeletal organization. As a result, dysregulation of LPA content may contribute to many CNS and PNS disorders such as chronic inflammatory or neuropathic pain, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), hemorrhagic hydrocephalus, schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, metabolic syndrome-induced brain damage, traumatic brain injury, hepatic encephalopathy-induced cerebral edema, macular edema, major depressive disorder, stress-induced psychiatric disorder, alcohol-induced brain damage, HIV-induced brain injury, pruritus, and peripheral nerve injury. ATX activity is now known to be the primary biological source of this bioactive signaling lipid, and as such, represents a potentially high-value drug target. There is currently one ATX inhibitor entering phase III clinical trials, with several additional preclinical compounds under investigation. This review discusses the physiological and pathological significance of the ATX-LPA-LPA receptor signaling axis and summarizes the evidence for targeting this pathway for the treatment of CNS diseases.

2020-01-01,"This essay uses gender as a category of historical and sociological analysis to situate two populations-boxers and victims of domestic violence-in context and explain the temporal and ontological discrepancies between them as potential brain injury patients. In boxing, the question of brain injury and its sequelae were analyzed from 1928 on, often on profoundly somatic grounds. With domestic violence, in contrast, the question of brain injury and its sequelae appear to have been first examined only after 1990. Symptoms prior to that period were often cast as functional in specific psychiatric and psychological nomenclatures. We examine this chronological and epistemological disconnection between forms of violence that appear otherwise highly similar even if existing in profoundly different spaces. "
2020-01-01,"This paper examines the entanglement of medicine, brain injury, and subjectivity within newspaper discourse and through the case of ex-American footballer Aaron Hernandez. In 2017, two years after being found guilty of murder and five years after scoring in the Super Bowl, Aaron Hernandez died by suicide in his prison cell. Hernandez was posthumously diagnosed with Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease associated with violence, depression, and dementia-like symptoms. I examine newspaper coverage of the Hernandez case, focusing upon the murder, arrests, conviction, suicide, and diagnosis of CTE in order to examine understandings of Hernandez's subjectivity. I make three conclusions: First, the disease is not mentioned prior to diagnosis with family instability, friendship groups, individual psychology, and the entitlement of celebrity foregrounded. Second, CTE is foregrounded after the diagnosis and is used to explain much of Hernandez's behaviour. Third, the diagnosis of CTE goes someway to normalizing the behaviour of Hernandez, rendering his behaviours comprehensible. I conclude by considering how the specific narrative of CTE-as-acquired-dementia shapes depictions of Hernandez's subjectivity and discuss how this case troubles existing literatures on the neurologization of selfhood.

2019-12-01,"The neuropathological features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury (TBI), include abnormal accumulations of hyper-phosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein in neurons, neurites and astrocytes, considered to progress via neuronal circuits in brains. Some previous reports suggest that a single severe TBI (sTBI) can also induce CTE and p-tau accumulation, but it is not clear whether the pathology is the same as that of repetitive TBI (rTBI). Since prefrontal leucotomy could be regarded as a model of sTBI, in this study we evaluated two autopsied schizophrenia with this procedure. Histopathologically, gliosis and neuronal loss were found not only in the primary ablated prefrontal region, but also in secondary affected areas, i.e., cingulate gyrus, medial nucleus of the thalamus, and nucleus accumbens, which are connected to prefrontal areas. Accumulation of p-tau was mostly seen in neurons, neurites and glias around small blood vessels in the leucotomized prefrontal region. In addition, secondary regions showed some p-tau-positive neurons/glias, as well as many axonal spheroids. Regions of neuronal/glial p-tau pathology showed immunoreactivity to both 3R/4R tau antibodies. Immunoblot analyses of sarkosyl-insoluble tau from frozen brains showed an AD-type tau banding pattern with strong immunoreactivities. sTBI patients showed limited comorbidities, such as TDP-43, alpha-synuclein or AD pathology, whereas rTBI patients have high frequencies of them. The findings suggest that p-tau in the primary affected lesion might progress to connected regions via neuronal circuits over time, and a single severe axonal injury might lead to CTE pathology different from that caused by rTBI.

2020-01-01,"Adenylate cyclase 5 (ADCY5)-related dyskinesia is a childhood-onset movement disorder. Manifestations vary in frequency and severity and may include chorea, tremor, dystonia, facial twitches, myoclonus, axial hypotonia, and limb hypertonia. Psychosis is likely part of the broader spectrum. ADCY5 is widely expressed in the brain, especially in the striatum. Previous reports of brain autopsies of 2 subjects with likely ADCY5-dyskinesia were limited by the absence of a molecular diagnosis. In 1 case, normal gross pathology was reported. In the other case, ADCY5 expression was not examined and neuropathological findings were confounded by age and comorbidities. To examine ADCY5 expression and neuropathological changes in ADCY5-dyskinesia. An extensive brain autopsy, including immunohistochemical analyses with antibodies to paired helical filament tau, α-synuclein, amyloid-β, microtubule-associated protein 2, and ADCY5, was performed. The patient, with a p.M1029K ADCY5 variant, had severe dyskinesias from early childhood, later recurrent episodes of psychosis, and died at age 46. Gross pathology was unremarkable, but we detected increased immunoreactivity for ADCY5 in neurons in multiple brain regions. Despite no history of brain trauma to suggest chronic traumatic encephalopathy, we found tau deposits in the deep cortical sulci, midbrain, and hippocampus with minimal amyloid pathology and no Lewy bodies. We present the first brain autopsy findings in a molecularly proven case of ADCY5-dyskinesia, showing increased ADCY5 immunoreactivity in neurons and evidence of tau deposition. Additional patients will need to be studied to determine whether increased immunoreactivity for ADCY5 is a signature for ADCY5-dyskinesia and whether this disease has a tauopathy component. "

The medial temporal lobe (MTL; i.e., hippocampus, subiculum, and entorhinal and perirhinal cortices) memory circuit displays tau lesions during the pathological progression of CTE. We examined MTL tissue obtained from 40 male Caucasian and African American athletes who received a postmortem CTE neuropathological diagnosis defined as stage II, III, or IV.

2019-12-01,"In post-industrial countries, ethnic minorities suffer poorer health and premature deaths. The present study examined ethnic differences in life expectancy and related features among elite heavyweight boxers. Dates of birth and death, anthropometry, and championship years were gathered from media archives for champions and challengers (never been a champion) between years 1889 and 2019. Cox regression adjusted for age at contest, nationality, BMI, champion/challenger status, and number of contests was used to assess survival. All 237 boxers, 83 champions (37.3% whites) and 154 challengers (61.0% whites), who contested for heavyweight championships were identified. By 2019, 110 (75 whites, 34 non-whites) were known to have died. Non-white boxers died at an earlier age than whites boxers (mean ± SD = 59.8 ± 14.2 years versus 67.3 ± 16.4 years, p = 0.018) and had shorter survival: HR = 2.13 (95% CI = 1.4-3.3). Among non-white boxers, deaths were higher from neurological disorders: OR = 8.2 (95% CI = 1.3-13.5) and accidents: OR = 15.1 (95% CI = 2.3-98.2), while death from natural causes was lower: OR = 0.2 (95% CI = 0.03-0.8). After boxing careers, fewer non-white boxers had non-manual jobs (34.4% versus 71.8%) than manual (34.4% versus 19.7%) or were unemployed (28.1% versus 2.8%). Reported substance abuse was similar across ethnicity (8.0% versus 8.8%) but conviction rates were higher among non-white boxers (17.6%) than white (1.3%). Compared with white boxers, non-white boxers tend to die younger with excess neurological and accidental deaths, and they have lower social positions in later life. Sporting authorities should reappraise the wisdom of permitting head injuries in sport and monitor and support the health and wellbeing of sports men and women after retirement. "
2019-12-01,"In the 20th century, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was conceptualized as a neurological disorder affecting some active and retired boxers who had tremendous exposure to neurotrauma. In recent years, the two research groups in the USA who have led the field have asserted definitively that CTE is a delayed-onset and progressive neurodegenerative disease, with symptoms appearing in midlife or decades after exposure. Between 2005 and 2012 autopsy cases of former boxers and American football players described neuropathology attributed to CTE that was broad and diverse. This pathology, resulting from multiple causes, was aggregated and referred to, in toto, as the pathology 'characteristic' of CTE. Preliminary consensus criteria for defining the neuropathology of CTE were forged in 2015 and published in 2016. Most of the macroscopic and microscopic neuropathological findings described as characteristic of CTE, in studies published before 2016, were not included in the new criteria for defining the pathology. In the past few years, there has been steadily emerging evidence that the neuropathology described as unique to CTE may not be unique. CTE pathology has been described in individuals with no known participation in collision or contact sports and no known exposure to repetitive neurotrauma. This pathology has been reported in individuals with substance abuse, temporal lobe epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple system atrophy, and other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, throughout history, some clinical cases have been described as not being progressive, and there is now evidence that CTE neuropathology might not be progressive in some individuals. Considering the current state of knowledge, including the absence of a series of validated sensitive and specific biomarkers, CTE pathology might not be inexorably progressive or specific to those who have experienced repetitive neurotrauma.

2019-12-01,"To evaluate the presence of tau deposition and pathologic features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in young adult patients treated with focal cortical resections for drug-resistant epilepsy. Sixty consecutive patients who had undergone surgical treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy between 18 and 45 years of age were identified (2010-2017). Medical records were reviewed to determine clinical factors, including history of head trauma, age at seizure onset, age at surgical resection, seizure type(s) and frequency, imaging findings, and surgical outcome. All formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded blocks from the surgical specimens from each subject were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin and antibodies to tau (Thermo Fisher Scientific Clone AT8), and examined blindly for tau pathology, including lesions characteristic of CTE. The median age at resection was 29.5 years (range = 19-45). A history of head trauma was reported in 19 patients. Although none of the patients had pathological findings characteristic of CTE, 23 patients (38%) demonstrated tau-immunoreactive lesions, including neurites, neurofibrillary pretangles, neurofibrillary tangles, subpial tau, and/or glial tau. In 4 of the 23 patients (7% of the cohort; 17% of those with tau pathology), substantial tau burden was identified. Three of these 4 patients had no significant history of head trauma; 1 patient had multiple sports-related concussions. No specific clinical factors correlated with the presence of tau pathology. Tau-immunoreactive lesions were found in 38% of 60 patients who underwent a focal cortical resection for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. Diagnostic features of CTE were not detected in any patient; however, the pathological evaluation for CTE was limited to a surgical specimen. The prominent and excessive tau deposition in 23 patients (38%) is abnormal in this age group and warrants further investigation. "
2019-12-01,"Evidence suggests that blast exposure has profound negative consequences for the health of the human brain, and that it may confer risk for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the molecular mechanisms linking blast exposure to subsequent neurodegeneration is an active focus of research, recent studies suggest that genetic risk for AD may elevate the risk of neurodegeneration following traumatic brain injury (TBI). However, it is currently unknown if blast exposure also interacts with AD risk to promote neurodegeneration. In this study we examined whether apolipoprotein (APOE) ɛ4, a well-known genetic risk factor for AD, influenced the relationship between blast exposure and white matter integrity in a cohort of 200 Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. Analyses revealed a significant interaction between close-range blast exposure (CBE) (close range being within 10 m) and APOE ɛ4 carrier status in predicting white matter abnormalities, measured by a voxelwise cluster-based method that captures spatial heterogeneity in white matter disruptions. This interaction remained significant after controlling for TBI, pointing to the specificity of CBE and APOE in white matter disruptions. Further, among veteran ɛ4 carriers exposed to close-range blast, we observed a positive association between the number of CBEs and the number of white matter abnormalities. These results raise the possibility that CBE interacts with AD genetic influences on neuropathological processes such as the degradation of white matter integrity. "
2019-12-01,"Globally, concussions in sport now attract far greater concern than several decades ago. Yet, no international scientific consensus exists for defining 'concussion,' or for determining how many brain injuries caused by a contact sport constitute a sufficient public health threat to warrant improving policies. How can policymakers help coaches, players, and parents work with public health authorities and clinicians to identify concussions, and prevent and treat head injuries? Doing so will require language that helps distinguish among the multitude of conditions related to Head Impact-Related Trauma in Sport (HIRTS), including sport-related concussion, post-concussion syndrome, second impact syndrome, and neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We propose a 'HIRTS framework' to advance public policy pertaining to head impacts and their effects. Given the scientific ambiguities regarding the definition, diagnosis, and markers of concussion and resulting complications, we encourage international policymakers, clinicians, and public health officials to adopt the following working definitions and concomitant policy recommendations to safeguard athletes' health and optimize tracking efforts, public education, funding, and government services.

2019-11-01,"Previous studies have shown that clinically asymptomatic high-acceleration head impacts (HHIs) may be associated with neuronal and axonal injury, as measured by advanced imaging and biomarkers. Unfortunately, these methods of measurement are time-consuming, invasive, and costly. A quick noninvasive measurement tool is needed to aid studies of head injury and its biological impact. Quantitative pupillometry is a potential objective, rapid, noninvasive measurement tool that may be used to assess the neurological effects of HHIs. In this study, the authors investigated the effect of HHIs on pupillary metrics, as measured using a pupillometer, in the absence of a diagnosed concussion. A prospective observational cohort study involving 18 high school football athletes was performed. These athletes were monitored for both the frequency and magnitude of head impacts that they sustained throughout a playing season by using the Head Impact Telemetry System. An HHI was defined as an impact exceeding 95g linear acceleration and 3760 rad/sec2 rotational acceleration. Pupillary assessments were performed at baseline, midseason, after occurrence of an HHI, and at the end of the season by using the NeurOptics NPi-200 pupillometer. The Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, 5th Edition (SCAT5), was also used at each time point. Comparisons of data obtained at the various time points were calculated using a repeated-measures analysis of variance and a t-test. Seven athletes sustained HHIs without a related diagnosed concussion. Following these HHIs, the athletes demonstrated decreases in pupil dilation velocity (mean difference 0.139 mm/sec; p = 0.048), percent change in pupil diameter (mean difference 3.643%; p = 0.002), and maximum constriction velocity (mean difference 0.744 mm/sec; p = 0.010), compared to measurements obtained at the athletes' own midseason evaluations. No significant changes occurred between the SCAT5 subtest scores calculated at midseason and those after a high impact, although the effect sizes (Cohen's d) on individual components ranged from 0.41 to 0.65. Measurable changes in pupil response were demonstrated following an HHI. These results suggest that clinically asymptomatic HHIs may affect brain reflex pathways, reflecting a biological injury previously seen when more invasive methods were applied. "

2019-11-01,"The effective management of sports-related concussion is an on-going problem in amateur sport due to a number of systemic issues. These factors have often been studied in isolation with minimal consideration for the interactions between them, or the overall system in which they occur. The aim of this research was to model the actors, controls, and feedback mechanisms influencing the management of concussion in community rugby union using the Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP) method. Findings show that there are currently many inadequate controls, that are directly and indirectly impacting effective concussion management. The practical implications of these findings are discussed (e.g. improved guideline education, mandatory medical presence, rule amendments). Additionally, the model provides a sound framework similar team sports can use to inform research into injury management and prevention (e.g. rugby league, hockey, AFL).  "
2019-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to increased rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms by which trauma can trigger neurodegeneration are increasingly understood. For example, diffuse axonal injury is implicated in disrupting microtubule function, providing the potential context for pathologies of tau and amyloid to develop. The neuropathology of post-traumatic dementias is increasingly well characterised, with recent work focusing on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, clinical diagnosis of post-traumatic dementia is problematic. It is often difficult to disentangle the direct effects of TBI from those produced by progressive neurodegeneration or other post-traumatic sequelae such as psychiatric impairment. CTE can only be confidently identified at postmortem and patients are often confused and anxious about the most likely cause of their post-traumatic problems. A new approach to the assessment of the long-term effects of TBI is needed. Accurate methods are available for the investigation of other neurodegenerative conditions. These should be systematically employed in TBI. MRI and positron emission tomography neuroimaging provide biomarkers of neurodegeneration which may be of particular use in the postinjury setting. Brain atrophy is a key measure of disease progression and can be used to accurately quantify neuronal loss. Fluid biomarkers such as neurofilament light can complement neuroimaging, representing sensitive potential methods to track neurodegenerative processes that develop after TBI. These biomarkers could characterise endophenotypes associated with distinct types of post-traumatic neurodegeneration. In addition, they might profitably be used in clinical trials of neuroprotective and disease-modifying treatments, improving trial design by providing precise and sensitive measures of neuronal loss.

2019-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability, contributing to ~30% of all injury-related deaths in the US. TBI occurs when a force transmitted to the head causes neuropathologic damage and impairment of brain function. TBI doubles risk of suicide and is the major determinant of acquired seizure disorders. TBI arising from closed head trauma (CHT) significantly increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Evidence for a possible role of TBI as a risk factor for sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (sALS) has been provided by studies of professional players of European football. Depending on age, genetic make-up (in particular, being a carrier of one or two ApoE4 alleles), the number of TBIs sustained, their severity, the time periods involved, and many other factors that affect vulnerability, decades may pass after occurrence of one or more TBIs before sequelae such as AD, PD, sALS or CTE become clinically evident. Among college and professional football players who experience repeated concussions and sub-concussive blows to the head, the risk of developing CTE increases with the number of years actively devoted to the sport, and the degree of exposure to physical impacts inherent in the position played. Following a moderate or severe concussion, or a series of mild blows to the head, the brain may undergo subtle pathophysiological changes that are unlikely to be detected with confidence using available diagnostic methods. Biomarkers are being sought that can help the attending physician infer the likely presence of an ongoing occult neurodegenerative process. One example of the adverse effect of collision on the brain is ""heading"" the soccer ball-a feat that, repeated over years of competition, has been found to produce severe brain damage in veteran players. CTE has attracted increasing national attention because of its devastating effects in a high proportion of retired professional players of American football. In a study of brains from deceased former football players, contributed mostly by family members, CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 110 of 111 of National Football League (NFL) veterans. In the CTE-positive subjects, the authors observed extensive brain atrophy, astrogliosis, myelinated axonopathy, microvascular injury, perivascular neuroinflammation, and phosphorylated tau protein pathology. CTE's neuropathology has been formally defined as a tauopathy characterized by a distinct perivascular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons and astrocytes within cerebral sulci. Although the mechanism that underlies the unforeseen emergence of CTE long after the occurrence of one or more closed head traumas is unknown, an explanation proposed by Albayram and associates is persuasive. They discovered TBI-induced neuronal production of the toxic compound cis P-tau, an abnormal and destructive isomer of the normal and benign trans P-tau, in mouse models of CTE. Cis P-tau produced a CTE-like syndrome via a process they termed cistauosis. Cistauosis can be blocked in laboratory animals by cis P-tau monoclonal antibody, which prevents later development of tau tangles, brain atrophy and virtual CTE. In a subsequent study, the same group found in human samples obtained post-TBI from a variety of causes, that cis P-tau is induced in cortical axons and cerebrospinal fluid and positively correlates with axonal injury and clinical outcome. Thus, cis P-tau appears to contribute to short-term and long-term sequelae after TBI, but may be subject to neutralization by cis-antibody treatment. "
2019-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) refers to any insult to the brain resulting in primary (direct) and secondary (indirect) damage to the brain parenchyma. Secondary damage is often linked to the molecular mechanisms that occur post TBI and result in excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation and cytokine damage, oxidative damage, and eventual cell death as prominent mechanisms of cell damage. We present a review highlighting the relation of each of these mechanisms with TBI, their mode of damaging brain tissue, and therapeutic correlation. We also mention the long-term sequelae and their pathophysiology in relation to TBI focusing on Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Understanding of the molecular mechanisms is important in order to realize the secondary and long-term sequelae that follow primary TBI and to devise targeted therapy for quick recovery accordingly.

2019-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy associated to repetitive head trauma. There are no validated in vivo biomarkers of CTE and a definite diagnosis can only be made at autopsy. Recent studies have shown that positron emission tomography (PET) tracer AV-1451 (Flortaucipir) exhibits high binding affinity for paired helical filament (PHF)-tau aggregates in Alzheimer (AD) brains but relatively low affinity for tau lesions in other tauopathies like temporal lobal degeneration (FTLD)-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Little is known, however, about the binding profile of this ligand to the tau-containing lesions of CTE. To study the binding properties of [ We performed [ Despite the presence of abundant tau aggregates in multiple regions in all CTE brains, only faint or no [ AV-1451 may have limited utility for in vivo selective and reliable detection of tau aggregates in CTE. The existence of disease-specific tau conformations may likely explain the differential binding affinity of this tracer for tau lesions in different tauopathies. "
2019-10-01,"Some researchers have claimed that former National Football League (NFL) players are at increased risk for suicide as a clinical feature of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This review examines the literature on risk for suicide in former professional football players, and the association between suicide and CTE. A narrative review of the literature published between 1928 and 2018. Between 1928 and 2009, suicide was not considered to be a clinical feature of CTE in the literature. The best available evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that former NFL football players are at lesser risk for suicide, not greater risk, compared to men in the general population. However, surveys have revealed that a substantial minority of former NFL players have depression and other mental health problems, chronic pain and opioid use is relatively common, and those with depression and chronic pain also have greater life stress and financial difficulties. That minority would be at increased risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to be cautious and circumspect when considering the clinical presentation of former athletes, and to not assume that depression and suicidality are caused by specific types of neuropathology. This represents a reductionistic and Procrustean view. Some former football players have mental health problems, but it should not be assumed uncritically that the underlying cause is an inexorably progressive neurodegenerative disease. Providing evidence-informed and evidence-supported treatments for depression and suicidality might reduce suffering and improve their functioning. "
2019-10-01,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a four-repeat tau proteinopathy. Abnormal tau deposition is not unique for PSP and is the basic pathologic finding in some other neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), age-related tauopathy, frontotemporal degeneration, corticobasal degeneration, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. While AD research has mostly been focused on amyloid beta pathology until recently, PSP as a prototype of a primary tauopathy with high clinical-pathologic correlation and a rapid course is a crucial candidate for tau therapeutic research. Several novel approaches to slow disease progression are being developed. It is expected that the benefits of translational research in this disease will extend beyond the PSP population. This article reviews advances in the diagnosis, epidemiology, pathology, hypothesized etiopathogenesis, and biomarkers and disease-modifying therapeutic approaches of PSP that is leading it to become a frontrunner in translation.

2019-10-01,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy that affects individuals with a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, such as American football players. Initial neuropathologic changes in CTE include perivascular deposition of phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau (p-tau) neurofibrillary tangles and other aggregates in neurons, astrocytes and cell processes in an irregular pattern often at the depths of the cortical sulci. In later stages, the p-tau depositions become widespread and is associated with neurodegeneration. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known to carry neuropathogenic molecules, most notably p-tau. We therefore examined the protein composition of EVs isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of former National Football League (NFL) players with cognitive and neuropsychiatric dysfunction, and an age-matched control group (CTRL) with no history of contact sports or traumatic brain injury. EVs were isolated from the CSF samples using an affinity purification kit. Total tau (t-tau) and tau phosphorylated on threonine181 (p-tau "
2019-10-01,"In recent years, it has been proposed that depression represents one clinical subtype of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This is the first study to examine the specificity of the research criteria for the clinical diagnosis of CTE in men with depression from the general population. Data from the National Comorbidity Survey Replication, an in-person survey that examined the prevalence and correlates of mental disorders in the United States, were used for this study. Men diagnosed as having a major depressive episode in the past 30 days were included (N=101; mean age=39.4 years, SD=12.9, range=18-71). They were deemed to meet research criteriafor CTE if they presented with the purported supportive clinical features of CTE (e.g., impulsivity and substance abuse, anxiety, apathy, suicidality, and headache). Approximately half of the sample (52.5%) met the proposed research criteria for CTE (i.e., traumatic encephalopathy syndrome). If one accepts the delayed-onset criterion as being present, meaning that the men in the sample were presenting with depression years after retirement from sports or the military, then 83.2% of this sample would meet the research criteria for diagnosis. The clinical problems attributed to CTE, such as depression, suicidality, anxiety, anger control problems, and headaches, co-occurred in this sample of men with depression from the general population-illustrating that these problems are not specific or unique to CTE. More research is needed to determine whether depression is, in fact, a clinical subtype of CTE. "
2019-10-01,"Cellular accumulation of aggregated forms of the protein tau is a defining feature of so-called tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. A growing body of literature suggests that conformational characteristics of tau filaments, along with regional vulnerability to tau pathology, account for the distinct histopathological morphologies, biochemical composition, and affected cell types seen across these disorders. In this review, we describe and discuss recent evidence from human postmortem and clinical biomarker studies addressing the differential vulnerability of brain areas to tau pathology, its cell-to-cell transmission, and characteristics of the different strains that tau aggregates can adopt. Cellular biosensor assays are increasingly used in human tissue to detect the earliest forms of tau pathology, before overt histopathological lesions (i.e., neurofibrillary tangles) are apparent. Animal models with localized tau expression are used to uncover the mechanisms that influence spreading of tau aggregates. Further, studies of human postmortem-derived tau filaments from different tauopathies injected in rodents have led to striking findings that recapitulate neuropathology-based staging of tau. Furthermore, the recent advent of tau positron emission tomography and novel fluid-based biomarkers render it possible to study the temporal progression of tau pathology in vivo. Ultimately, evidence from these approaches must be integrated to better understand the onset and progression of tau pathology across tauopathies. This will lead to improved methods for the detection and monitoring of disease progression and, hopefully, to the development and refinement of tau-based therapeutics. "

2019-10-01,"Tau deposits is a core feature of neurodegenerative disorder following traumatic brain injury (TBI). Despite ample evidence from post-mortem studies demonstrating exposure to both mild-repetitive and severe TBIs are linked to tau depositions, associations of topology of tau lesions with late-onset psychiatric symptoms due to TBI have not been explored. To address this issue, we assessed tau deposits in long-term survivors of TBI by PET with 11C-PBB3, and evaluated those associations with late-life neuropsychiatric outcomes. PET data were acquired from 27 subjects in the chronic stage following mild-repetitive or severe TBI and 15 healthy control subjects. Among the TBI patients, 14 were diagnosed as having late-onset symptoms based on the criteria of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome. For quantification of tau burden in TBI brains, we calculated 11C-PBB3 binding capacity (cm3), which is a summed voxel value of binding potentials (BP*ND) multiplied by voxel volume. Main outcomes of the present study were differences in 11C-PBB3 binding capacity between groups, and the association of regional 11C-PBB3 binding capacity with neuropsychiatric symptoms. To confirm 11C-PBB3 binding to tau deposits in TBI brains, we conducted in vitro PBB3 fluorescence and phospho-tau antibody immunofluorescence labelling of brain sections of chronic traumatic encephalopathy obtained from the Brain Bank. Our results showed that patients with TBI had higher 11C-PBB3 binding capacities in the neocortical grey and white matter segments than healthy control subjects. Furthermore, TBI patients with traumatic encephalopathy syndrome showed higher 11C-PBB3 binding capacity in the white matter segment than those without traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, and regional assessments revealed that subgroup difference was also significant in the frontal white matter. 11C-PBB3 binding capacity in the white matter segment correlated with the severity of psychosis. In vitro assays demonstrated PBB3-positive tau inclusions at the depth of neocortical sulci, confirming 11C-PBB3 binding to tau lesions. In conclusion, increased 11C-PBB3 binding capacity is associated with late-onset neuropsychiatric symptoms following TBI, and a close correlation was found between psychosis and 11C-PBB3 binding capacity in the white matter.

2019-04-01,"In recent years, it has been proposed that problems with anger control and depression define clinical features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The authors examined anger problems and depression in middle-aged men from the general population and related those findings to the proposed clinical criteria for CTE. A sample of 166 community-dwelling men ages 40-60 was extracted from the normative database of the National Institutes of Health Toolbox. All participants denied prior head injury or traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants completed scales assessing anger, hostility, aggression, anxiety, and depression. In response to the item ""I felt angry,"" 21.1% of men reported ""sometimes,"" and 4.8% reported ""often."" When asked ""If I am provoked enough I may hit another person,"" 11.4% endorsed the statement as true. There were moderate correlations between anger and anxiety (Spearman's ρ=0.61) and between depression and affective anger (ρ=0.51), hostility (ρ=0.56), and perceived hostility (ρ=0.35). Participants were dichotomized into a possible depression group (N=49) and a no-depression group (N=117) on the basis of the question ""I feel depressed,"" specific to the past 7 days. The possible depression group reported higher anxiety (p<0.001, Cohen's d=1.51), anger (p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.96), and hostility (p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.95). Some degree of anger and aggression are reported by a sizable minority of middle-aged men in the general population with no known history of TBI. Anger and hostility are correlated with depression and anxiety, indicating that all tend to co-occur. The base rates and comorbidity of affective dysregulation in men in the general population is important to consider when conceptualizing CTE phenotypes. "
2019-10-01,"Sports-related head trauma has emerged as an important public health issue, as mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBIs) may result in neurodegenerative disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Research into mTBI and CTE pathophysiology are difficult to undertake in athletes, with observational trials and post-mortem analysis the current mainstays. Thus, animal models play an important role in the study of mTBI, however, traditional animal models have focused on acute, severe injuries rather than the more typical mTBI's seen in sport injuries. Recently, a number of animal models have been developed that are both appropriately scaled and biomechanically relevant to the forces sustained by athletes. This review aimed to examine the literature for variables included in these animal models, and the resulting neurotrauma as evidenced by pathology and behavioral deficits. A systematic search of the literature was performed in multiple electronic databases. The inclusion criteria required mimicry of athlete mTBI conditions: freedom of head movement, lack of surgical alteration of the skull, and application of direct contact force. Studies were analyzed for variables including apparatus design features (impact force, change in animal head velocity, and kinetic energy transfer to the head), demonstrated pathology (phosphorylated tau, TDP-43 aggregation, diffuse axonal injury, gliosis, cytokine inflammation response, and genetic integrity), and behavioral changes. These studies suggested that appropriate animal models can assist in understanding the pathological and functional outcomes of athlete mTBI, and could be used as a platform for future studies of diagnostic/prognostic markers and in the development of treatment interventions.

2019-10-01,"Sports-related encephalopathies are a growing concern among athletes who have experienced head trauma. Anxiety is heightened for the public and especially among parents of children playing contact sports. The most common neuropsychological conditions are concussions and traumatic encephalopathies. Concussions result from brain traumas that can be asymptomatic, but more serious concussions can include loss of consciousness, neurological abnormalities, and/or posttraumatic amnesias. Repetitive concussions lead to persistent brain pathology, known as chronic traumatic encephalopathies. This gradually progressive neurodegenerative disease frequently presents with cognitive and neurological deficits, which can result in significant parkinsonian features and dementia. Imaging studies may be noncontributory; however, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and functional magnetic resonance imaging can detect changes indicative of these encephalopathies. Progressive neuronal degeneration with tau proteins are documented on pathological examination. Prevention, early diagnosis, and proper treatment are the recommended approach to these conditions. "
2019-09-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) because these conditions share common pathological hallmarks: amyloid-β and hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation. However, given recent data it is uncertain if a history of TBI leads to the development of AD. Moreover, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repetitive mild TBI and characterized by progressive neurodegeneration with hyperphosphorylated tau, has come to be recognized as distinct from AD. Therefore, it is important to elucidate the clinical outcomes and molecular mechanisms underlying tau pathology following TBI. We summarize the histopathological features and clinical course of TBI in CTE, comparing the tau pathology with that in AD. Following brain injury, diffuse axonal injury, and hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates are observed within a shorter period than in AD. Hyperphosphorylated tau deposition usually begins in the perivascular area of the sulci in the cerebral cortex, then spreads unevenly in the cortex in CTE, while AD shows diffuse distribution of hyperphosphorylated tau in the cortical areas. We also highlight the molecular profile of tau and the implications of tau progression throughout the brain in both diseases. Tau contains phosphorylation sites common to both conditions. In particular, phosphorylation at Thr "
2019-09-01,"Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) consists of beta-amyloid deposition in the walls of the cerebrovasculature and is commonly associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the association of CAA with repetitive head impacts (RHI) and with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is unknown. We evaluated the relationship between RHI from contact sport participation, CTE, and CAA within a group of deceased contact sport athletes (n = 357), a community-based cohort (n = 209), and an AD cohort from Boston University AD Center (n = 241). Unsupervised hierarchal cluster analysis demonstrated a unique cluster (n = 11) with increased CAA in the leptomeningeal vessels compared to the intracortical vessels (p < 0.001) comprised of participants with significantly greater frequencies of CTE (7/11) and history of RHI. Overall, participants with CTE (n = 251) had more prevalent (p < 0.001) and severe (p = 0.010) CAA within the frontal leptomeningeal vessels compared to intracortical vessels. Compared to those with AD, participants with CTE had more severe CAA in frontal than parietal lobes (p < 0.001) and more severe CAA in leptomeningeal than intracortical vessels (p = 0.002). The overall frequency of CAA in participants with CTE was low, and there was no significant association between contact sport participation and the presence of CAA. However, in those with CAA, a history of contact sports was associated with increased CAA severity in the frontal leptomeningeal vessels (OR = 4.01, 95% CI 2.52-6.38, p < 0.001) adjusting for AD, APOE ε4 status, and age. Participants with CAA had increased levels of sulcal tau pathology and decreased levels of the synaptic marker PSD-95 (p's < 0.05), and CAA was a predictor of dementia (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.02-2.99, p = 0.043) adjusting for age, sex, and comorbid pathology. Overall, contact sport participation and CTE were associated with more severe frontal and leptomeningeal CAA, and CAA was independently associated with worse pathological and clinical outcomes. "
2019-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is reported at high prevalence in selected autopsy case series of former contact sports athletes. Nevertheless, the contribution of CTE pathology to clinical presentation and its interaction with co-morbid neurodegenerative pathologies remain unclear. To address these issues, we performed comprehensive neuropathology assessments on the brains of former athletes with dementia and considered these findings together with detailed clinical histories to derive an integrated clinicopathological diagnosis for each case. Consecutive, autopsy-acquired brains from former soccer and rugby players with dementia were assessed for neurodegenerative pathologies using established and preliminary consensus protocols. Thereafter, next of kin interviews were conducted to obtain detailed accounts of the patient's clinical presentation and course of disease to inform a final, integrated clinicopathological diagnosis. Neuropathologic change consistent with CTE (CTE-NC) was confirmed in five of seven former soccer and three of four former rugby players' brains, invariably in combination with mixed, often multiple neurodegenerative pathologies. However, in just three cases was the integrated dementia diagnosis consistent with CTE, the remainder having alternate diagnoses, with the most frequent integrated diagnosis Alzheimer's disease (AD) (four cases; one as mixed AD and vascular dementia). This consecutive autopsy series identifies neuropathologic change consistent with preliminary diagnostic criteria for CTE (CTE-NC) in a high proportion of former soccer and rugby players dying with dementia. However, in the majority, CTE-NC appears as a co-morbidity rather than the primary, dementia causing pathology. As such, we suggest that while CTE-NC might be common in former athletes with dementia, in many cases its clinical significance remains uncertain. "
2019-09-01,"A mechanics-based brain damage framework is used to model the abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated p-tau associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy within the brains of deceased National Football League (NFL) players studied at Boston University and to provide a framework for understanding the damage mechanisms. p-tau damage is formulated as the multiplicative decomposition of three independently evolving damage internal state variables (ISVs): nucleation related to number density, growth related to the average area, and coalescence related to the nearest neighbor distance. The ISVs evolve under different rates for three well known mechanical boundary conditions, which in themselves introduce three different rates making a total of nine scenarios, that we postulate are related to brain damage progression: (1) monotonic overloads, (2) cyclic fatigue which corresponds to repetitive impacts, and (3) creep which is correlated to damage accumulation over time. Different NFL player positions are described to capture the different types of damage progression. Skill position players, such as quarterbacks, are expected to exhibit a greater p-tau protein accumulation during low cycle fatigue (higher amplitude impacts with a lesser number), and linemen who exhibit a greater p-tau protein accumulation during high cycle fatigue (lower amplitude impacts with a greater number of impacts). This mechanics-based damage framework presents a foundation for developing a multiscale model for traumatic brain injury that combines mechanics with biology. "
2019-09-01,"Cerebral atrophy in response to traumatic brain injury is a well-documented phenomenon in both primary investigations and review articles. Recent atrophy studies focus on exploring the region-specific patterns of cerebral atrophy; yet, there is no study that analyzes and synthesizes the emerging atrophy patterns in a single comprehensive review. Here we attempt to fill this gap in our current knowledge by integrating the current literature into a cohesive theory of preferential brain tissue loss and by identifying common risk factors for accelerated atrophy progression. Our review reveals that observations for mild traumatic brain injury remain inconclusive, whereas observations for moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury converge towards robust patterns: brain tissue loss is on the order of 5% per year, and occurs in the form of generalized atrophy, across the entire brain, or focal atrophy, in specific brain regions. The most common regions of focal atrophy are the thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum in gray matter and the corpus callosum, corona radiata, and brainstem in white matter. We illustrate the differences of generalized and focal gray and white matter atrophy on emerging deformation and stress profiles across the whole brain using computational simulation. The characteristic features of our atrophy simulations-a widening of the cortical sulci, a gradual enlargement of the ventricles, and a pronounced cortical thinning-agree well with clinical observations. Understanding region-specific atrophy patterns in response to traumatic brain injury has significant implications in modeling, simulating, and predicting injury outcomes. Computational modeling of brain atrophy could open new strategies for physicians to make informed decisions for whom, how, and when to administer pharmaceutical treatment to manage the chronic loss of brain structure and function.

2019-09-01,"Preclinical models for mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) need to recapitulate several essential clinical features associated with mTBI, including a lack of significant neuropathology and the onset of neurocognitive symptoms normally associated with mTBI. Here we show how to establish a protocol for reliably and repeatedly inducing a mild awake closed head injury (ACHI) in rats, with no mortality or clinical indications of persistent pain. Moreover, we implement a new rapid neurological assessment protocol (NAP) that can be completely conducted within 1 min of each impact. This ACHI model will help to rectify the paucity of data on how repeated mTBI (r-mTBI) impacts the juvenile brain, an area of significant concern in clinical populations where there is evidence that behavioral sequelae following injury can be more persistent in juveniles. In addition, the ACHI model can help determine if r-mTBI early in life can predispose the brain to exhibiting greater neuropathology (i.e., chronic traumatic encephalopathy) later in life and can facilitate the identification of critical periods of vulnerability to r-mTBI across the lifespan. This article describes the protocol for administering an awake closed head mTBI (i.e., ACHI) to rats, as well as how to perform a rapid NAP following each ACHI. Methods for administering the ACHI to individual subjects repeatedly are described, as are the methods and scoring system for the NAP. The goal of this article is to provide a standardized set of procedures allowing the ACHI and NAP protocols to be used reliably by different laboratories. © 2019 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc. "
2019-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is very frequent and studied among contact sport players, above all American Football. Now, the defined diagnosis is only post-mortem and, consequently, more detailed diagnostic in-vivo instruments are needed to facilitate diagnosis and to allow a follow up. This clinical questionnaire (Trauma Questionnaire-TraQ) has been designed to investigate in parallel the traumatic load and clinical and cognitive subjective symptoms. It evaluates 4 anamnestic fields (specific sport activity, all previous pathological events, clinical manifestations compatible with TBI (traumatic brain injury) or CTE and subjective perception of personal memory efficacy with PRMQ questionnaire). The aim of TraQ questionnaire is to allow a standardized follow-up of active players and to identify subclinical disturbances that may become warnings. A pilot comparative study with TraQ on 105 subjects (75 AF players and 30 comparable people without a history of contact-sports activity) revealed that AF players have an increased amount of severe head trauma, an amplified level of subjective aggressiveness, more olfactory deficits but also more speech subjective problems, previously never related with CTE. In view of the obtained results, the TraQ seems to be useful (1) to obtain a better quantification of the traumatic load; (2) to differentiate the risk of long-term neurological consequences, allowing better management of different athletes right from the pre-symptomatic phases; (3) to manage prevention strategies if regularly applied to periodic visits to sports fitness; and (4) to identify the predisposing factors for the development of CTE and other neurological consequences of TBI with follow-up studies.

2019-08-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an unfortunately common event in military life. The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have increased public awareness of TBI in the military. Certain injury mechanisms are relatively unique to the military, the most prominent being blast exposure. Blast-related mild TBI (mTBI) has been of particular concern in the most recent veterans although controversy remains concerning separation of the postconcussion syndrome associated with mTBI from post-traumatic stress disorder. TBI is also a risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD, TBI, and CTE are all associated with chronic inflammation. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple genetic loci associated with AD that implicate inflammation and - in particular microglia - as key modulators of the AD- and TBI-related degenerative processes. At the molecular level, recent studies have identified TREM2 and TYROBP/DAP12 as components of a key molecular hub linking inflammation and microglia to the pathophysiology of AD and possibly TBI. Evidence concerning the relationship of TBI to chronic mental health problems and dementia is reviewed in the context of its relevance to military veterans. "
2019-08-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one the most common human afflictions, contributing to long-term disability in survivors. Emerging data indicate that functional improvement or deterioration can occur years after TBI. In this regard, TBI is recognized as risk factor for late-life neurodegenerative disorders. TBI encompasses a heterogeneous disease process in which diverse injury subtypes and multiple molecular mechanisms overlap. To develop precision medicine approaches where specific pathobiological processes are targeted by mechanistically appropriate therapies, techniques to identify and measure these subtypes are needed. Traumatic microvascular injury is a common but relatively understudied TBI endophenotype. In this review, we describe evidence of microvascular dysfunction in human and animal TBI, explore the role of vascular dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease, and discuss potential opportunities for vascular-directed therapies in ameliorating TBI-related neurodegeneration. We discuss the therapeutic potential of vascular-directed therapies in TBI and the use and limitations of preclinical models to explore these therapies. "
2019-08-01,"The midbrain is biomechanically susceptible to force loading from repetitive subconcussive head impacts (RSHI), is a site of tauopathy in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and regulates functions (e.g., eye movements) often disrupted in concussion. In a prospective longitudinal design, we demonstrate there are reductions in midbrain white matter integrity due to a single season of collegiate football, and that the amount of reduction in midbrain white matter integrity is related to the amount of rotational acceleration to which players' brains are exposed. We then replicate the observation of reduced midbrain white matter integrity in a retrospective cohort of individuals with frank concussion, and further show that variance in white matter integrity is correlated with levels of serum-based tau, a marker of blood-brain barrier disruption. These findings mean that noninvasive structural MRI of the midbrain is a succinct index of both clinically silent white matter injury as well as frank concussion. "

2019-08-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive head impacts, including those from US football, that presents with cognitive and neuropsychiatric disturbances that can progress to dementia. Pathways to dementia in CTE are unclear and likely involve tau and nontau pathologic conditions. To investigate the association of white matter rarefaction and cerebrovascular disease with dementia in deceased men older than 40 years who played football and had CTE. This cross-sectional study involves analyses of data from the ongoing Understanding Neurologic Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) Study, which is conducted via and included brain donors from the Veterans Affairs-Boston University-Concussion Legacy Foundation brain bank between 2008 and 2017. An original sample of 224 men who had played football and were neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE was reduced after exclusion of those younger than 40 years and those missing data. The number of years of football play as a proxy for repetitive head impacts. Neuropathological assessment of white matter rarefaction and arteriolosclerosis severity (on a scale of 0-3, where 3 is severe); number of infarcts, microinfarcts, and microbleeds; and phosphorylated tau accumulation determined by CTE stage and semiquantitative rating of dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (none or mild vs moderate or severe). Informant-based retrospective clinical interviews determined dementia diagnoses via diagnostic consensus conferences. A total of 180 men were included. The mean (SD) age of the sample at death was 67.9 (12.7) years. Of 180, 120 [66.7%]) were found to have had dementia prior to death. Moderate to severe white matter rarefaction (84 of 180 [46.6%]) and arteriolosclerosis (85 of 180 [47.2%]) were common; infarcts, microinfarcts, and microbleeds were not. A simultaneous equations regression model controlling for age and race showed that more years of play was associated with more severe white matter rarefaction (β, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.02-0.29]; P = .03) and greater phosphorylated tau accumulation (DLFC NFTs: β, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.004-0.30]; P = .04; CTE stage: β, 0.27 [95% CI, 0.14-0.41]; P < .001). White matter rarefaction (β, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.02-0.29]; P = .03) and DLFC NFTs (β, 0.16 [95% CI, 0.03-0.28]; P = .01) were associated with dementia. Arteriolosclerosis and years of play were not associated, but arteriolosclerosis was independently associated with dementia (β, 0.21 [95% CI, 0.07-0.35]; P = .003). Among older men who had played football and had CTE, more years of football play were associated with more severe white matter rarefaction and greater DLFC NFT burden. White matter rarefaction, arteriolosclerosis, and DLFC NFTs were independently associated with dementia. Dementia in CTE is likely a result of neuropathologic changes, including white matter rarefaction and phosphorylated tau, associated with repetitive head impact and pathologic changes not associated with head trauma, such as arteriolosclerosis.

2019-08-01,"Sport-related concussion (SRC) has been associated with cognitive impairment, depression, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. American football is the most popular sport among males in the United States and has one of the highest concussion rates among high school sports. Measured head impacts and concussions are approximately 4 times more common in contact practices compared with noncontact practices. The Wisconsin Interscholastic Athletic Association passed new rules defining and limiting contact during practice before the 2014 football season. To determine if the SRC rate is lower after a rule change that limited the amount and duration of full-contact activities during high school football practice sessions. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. A total of 2081 high school football athletes enrolled and participated in the study in 2012-2013 (before the rule change), and 945 players participated in the study in 2014 (after the rule change). Players self-reported previous concussion and demographic information. Athletic trainers recorded athlete exposures (AEs), concussion incidence, and days lost for each SRC. Chi-square tests were used to compare the incidence of SRC in prerule 2012-2013 seasons with the incidence in the postrule 2014 season. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to determine differences in days lost because of SRC. A total of 67 players (7.1%) sustained 70 SRCs in 2014. The overall rate of SRC per 1000 AEs was 1.28 in 2014 as compared with 1.58 in 2012-2013 ( The rate of SRC sustained in high school football practice decreased by 57% after a rule change limiting the amount and duration of full-contact activities, with no change in competition concussion rate. Limitations on contact during high school football practice may be one effective measure to reduce the incidence of SRC. "
2019-08-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a postmortem diagnosis. Consensus postmortem, but not antemortem, diagnostic criteria have been established. A key factor in these criteria is evidence of phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) around sulcal vessels in the cortex. However, this sign has been observed anecdotally in a diverse range of neurodegenerative diseases (NDD). We therefore hypothesise that this criterion may lack specificity. To test this, we assessed patients with NDD, but no documented history of brain trauma, for sulcal p-tau. Tissue was retrieved from Dublin Brain Bank (known NDD n = 17; control with no diagnosed NDD n = 6; CTE n = 1), and slides were prepared from three sites with a predilection for trauma: superior frontal gyrus, temporal pole, and superior temporal gyrus. We stained the resulting anonymised slides with both hemotoxylin and eosin (H&E) and p-tau. Three neuropathologists, blinded to the clinical history and neuropathological diagnosis in each instance, evaluated each case for sulcal p-tau. We calculated the interrater agreement, using Fleiss's kappa, and the specificity of this neuropathological sign. Sulcal p-tau was highly specific to diagnosed CTE cases (specificity 0.98), with moderate interrater agreement (κ = 0.45). In conclusion, therefore, we observed sulcal p-tau to be a sign highly specific to CTE when compared with NDD cases in the absence of head trauma. "

Even some of the most well-accepted causal associations in public health, such as that linking cigarette smoking to increased lung cancer risk, have intriguing research questions remaining to be answered. The inquiry whether an exposure causes a disease is never wholly a yes/no question but ought to follow from an appraisal of the weight of evidence supporting the positive conclusion in light of any coherent theories casting doubt on this evidence and the data supporting these. More importantly, such an appraisal cannot be made sensibly without considering the relative consequences to public health and economic welfare of specific  "
2019-07-01,"Tauopathies are a heterogenous class of diseases characterized by cellular accumulation of aggregated tau and include diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Tau pathology is strongly linked to neurodegeneration and clinical symptoms in tauopathy patients. Furthermore, synapse loss is an early pathological event in tauopathies and is the strongest correlate of cognitive decline. Tau pathology is additionally associated with chronic neuroinflammatory processes, such as reactive microglia, astrocytes, and increased levels of pro-inflammatory molecules (e.g. complement proteins, cytokines). Recent studies show that as the principal immune cells of the brain, microglia play a particularly important role in the initiation and progression of tau pathology and associated neurodegeneration. Furthermore, AD risk genes such as Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) and Apolipoprotein E (APOE) are enriched in the innate immune system and modulate the neuroinflammatory response of microglia to tau pathology. Microglia can play an active role in synaptic dysfunction by abnormally phagocytosing synaptic compartments of neurons with tau pathology. Furthermore, microglia are involved in synaptic spreading of tau - a process which is thought to underlie the progressive nature of tau pathology propagation through the brain. Spreading of pathological tau is also the predominant target for tau-based immunotherapy. Active tau vaccines, therapeutic tau antibodies and other approaches targeting the immune system are actively explored as treatment options for AD and other tauopathies. This review describes the role of microglia in the pathobiology of tauopathies and the mechanism of action of potential therapeutics targeting the immune system in tauopathies. "
2019-07-01,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a debilitating neurodegenerative disease, which has been increasingly reported in athletes, especially American football players, as well as military veterans in combat settings, commonly as a result of repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). CTE has a unique neuropathological signature comprised of accumulation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in sulci and peri-vascular regions, microgliosis, and astrocytosis. As per most recent disease classification, the disease manifests itself in four different stages, characterized by widespread tauopathy. Clinically, CTE has a more subtle presentation, as patients often present with two distinct phenotypes, with one subtype initially presenting with affective changes, and the other subtype with more cognitive impairment. On a genetic basis, there are no clear risk factor genes. Although ApoE4 carriers have been reported to suffer more severe outcome post TBI. As there are no disease modifying regimen for CTE, the newly developed TBI treatments, if administered in a time sensitive manner, can offer a potential viable option. Prevention is another key strategy that needs to be implemented in various sports and military settings. Providing education for safe practice techniques, such as safe tackling and hitting, and providing ready access to full neuropsychiatric assessment by team physician could have measurable benefits. The combination of advanced of research techniques including neuroimaging, as well as increasing public awareness of CTE, offers promising vistas for research advancement. "
2019-07-01,"Depression strongly predicts stroke incidence, suggesting that treating depression may reduce stroke risk. Antidepressant medications, however, may increase stroke risk via direct pathways. Previous evidence on antidepressant medication and stroke incidence is mixed. We evaluated associations between antidepressant use and incident stroke. For 2302 Adult Changes in Thought cohort participants with no stroke at study entry, we characterized antidepressant use from pharmacy records, biennial depressive symptoms with a 10-item Centers for Epidemiologic Study-Depression scale, and incident strokes from ICD codes. We used discrete-time survival models with inverse probability weighting to compare stroke risk associated with filling antidepressant prescriptions and by medication category: tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or other. Over an average 8.4-year follow-up, 441 incident strokes occurred. Filling antidepressant medications 3+ times versus 0-2 times predicted 35% increased odds of stroke (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 0.98, 1.66). Use of TCAs was associated with stroke onset (OR per 10 fills = 1.28; CI: 1.04, 1.57), but use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (OR = 0.98; CI: 0.80, 1.20) or other antidepressants (OR = 0.99; CI: 0.67, 1.45) was not. Although patients who received antidepressant medication were at higher risk of stroke, this association appeared specific to TCA prescriptions. "
2019-07-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) affects at least 3 M people annually. In humans, repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI) can lead to increased impulsivity and may be associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. To better understand the relationship between repetitive TBI (rTBI), impulsivity and neuropathology, we used CHIMERA (Closed-Head Injury Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration) to deliver five TBIs to rats, which were continuously assessed for trait impulsivity using the delay discounting task and for neuropathology at endpoint. Compared to sham controls, rats with rTBI displayed progressive impairment in impulsive choice. Histological analyses revealed reduced dopaminergic innervation from the ventral tegmental area to the olfactory tubercle, consistent with altered impulsivity neurocircuitry. Consistent with diffuse axonal injury generated by CHIMERA, white matter inflammation, tau immunoreactivity and degeneration were observed in the optic tract and corpus callosum. Finally, pronounced grey matter microgliosis was observed in the olfactory tubercle. Our results provide insight into the mechanisms by which rTBI leads to post-traumatic psychiatric-like symptoms in a novel rat TBI platform. "
2019-07-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was initially conceptualized in boxers, but has extended to other athletes in recent years, albeit with limited clinical correlations. It is often asserted that CTE pathology represents the substrate for progressive neurodegenerative disease. We report the case of a shotgun injury to the brain with 42-year survival and no neurological disease progression until shortly before death. The decedent had no other traumatic brain injury (TBI) exposure and did not play football or other high energy collision sport. Neuropathological examination confirmed tissue damage, but additionally demonstrated localized patterns of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) meeting criteria for CTE pathology. P-tau and TDP-43 deposits within marginal tissue of damaged brain were also present focally. No amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits were present. These findings indicate that CTE pathology may occur following a single, severe TBI. "
2019-07-01,"It has been asserted that chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) pathology is only present in former athletes and others who have been exposed to repetitive concussions, subconcussive blows, or both. We hypothesized that CTE pathology would be present in men who had no known history of repetitive neurotrauma. Comprehensive medical record reviews and health surveys completed by a family member were available for the 8 men in this case series, none of whom had known exposure to repetitive neurotrauma but 2 of whom had a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Postmortem tissue was immunostained for hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) to assess for CTE pathology, Braak stage, and aging-related p-tau. The neuropathologist was blind to age, personal history, and clinical history. Six of the 8 cases (75%) showed p-tau in neurons, astrocytes, and cell processes around small blood vessels in an irregular pattern at the depths of the cortical sulci. The changes were focal and limited in terms of overall extent, and some of the cases had a clearer pattern of pathology and some could be considered equivocal. Two of the 8 cases had a history of TBI and one of them showed CTE pathology. Five of the 6 cases with no known history of neurotrauma appeared to meet consensus criteria for CTE. This study adds to the emerging literature indicating that CTE pathology is present in people not known to have experienced multiple concussions or subconcussive blows to the head. "
2019-07-01,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is common in many populations, including athletes, veterans, and domestic abuse victims. mTBI can cause chronic symptoms, including depression, irritability, memory problems, and attention deficits. A history of repetitive mTBI has been epidemiologically associated with developing early-onset dementia and neurodegenerative diseases and, in particular, is thought to be the underlying cause of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-a progressive tauopathy diagnosed by the presence of perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau) in the depths of cortical sulci. However, the scarce and focal pathology often seen in CTE does not correlate with the severity of symptoms experienced by patients. This paper proposes accumulation of γH2AX, a marker of double-stranded DNA damage, as a novel pathological marker to identify brain damage post-mTBI. We present two cases of men with history of mTBI. Immunohistochemistry revealed extensive DNA damage throughout the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and brainstem areas. Furthermore, gene expression profiling showed increases of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2), two serine/threonine kinases recruited in response to double-strand breaks in the DNA damage response pathway. These cases highlight the complex pathophysiology of head trauma, and suggest DNA damage as the molecular mechanism behind mTBI-induced pathology and symptoms. "
2019-07-01,"We review the literature on Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies in aged human brains and the relevant underlying pathogenetic cascades. Complex interacting pathways are implicated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD), wherein multiple proteins tend to misfold in a manner that is ""reactive,"" but, subsequently, each proteinopathy may contribute strongly to the clinical symptoms. Tau proteinopathy exists in brains of individuals across a broad spectrum of primary underlying conditions-e.g., developmental, traumatic, and inflammatory/infectious diseases. TDP-43 proteinopathy is also expressed in a wide range of clinical disorders.  Although TDP-43 proteinopathy was first described in the central nervous system of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and in subtypes of frontotemporal dementia (FTD/FTLD), TDP-43 proteinopathy is also present in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cognitively impaired persons in advanced age with hippocampal sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other diseases. We list known Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies.  There is also evidence of cellular co-localization between Tau and TDP-43 misfolded proteins, suggesting common pathways or protein interactions facilitating misfolding in one protein by the other. Multiple pleiotropic gene variants can alter risk for Tau or TDP-43 pathologies, and certain gene variants (e.g., APOE ε4, Huntingtin triplet repeats) are associated with increases of both Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies. Studies of genetic risk factors have provided insights into multiple nodes of the pathologic cascades involved in Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies. Variants from a specific gene can be either a low-penetrant risk factor for a group of diseases, or alternatively, a different variant of the same gene may be a disease-driving allele that is associated with a relatively aggressive and early-onset version of a clinically and pathologically specific disease type. Overall, a complex but enlightening paradigm has emerged, wherein both Tau and TDP-43 proteinopathies are linked to numerous overlapping upstream influences, and both are associated with multiple downstream pathologically- and clinically-defined deleterious effects.

2019-07-01,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a trinucleotide expansion in the huntingtin gene. Recently, a new role for tau has been implicated in the pathogenesis of HD, whereas others have argued that postmortem tau pathology findings are attributable to concurrent Alzheimer's disease pathology. The frequency of other well-defined common age-related tau pathologies in HD has not been examined in detail. In this single center, retrospective analysis, we screened seven cases of Huntington's disease (5 females, 2 males, age at death: 47-73 years) for neuronal and glial tau pathology using phospho-tau immunohistochemistry. All seven cases showed presence of neuronal tau pathology. Five cases met diagnostic criteria for primary age-related tauopathy (PART), with three cases classified as definite PART and two cases as possible PART, all with a Braak stage of I. One case was diagnosed with low level of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change. In the youngest case, rare perivascular aggregates of tau-positive neurons, astrocytes and processes were identified at sulcal depths, meeting current neuropathological criteria for stage 1 chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Although the patient had no history of playing contact sports, he experienced several falls, but no definitive concussions during his disease course. Three of the PART cases and the CTE-like case showed additional evidence of aging-related tau astrogliopathy. None of the cases showed significant tau pathology in the striatum. In conclusion, while we found evidence for tau hyperphosphorylation and aggregation in all seven of our HD cases, the tau pathology was readily classifiable into known diagnostic entities and most likely represents non-specific age- or perhaps trauma-related changes. As the tau pathology was very mild in all cases and not unexpected for a population of this age range, it does not appear that the underlying HD may have promoted or accelerated tau accumulation. "
2019-07-01,"Traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy are both major health problems, well-publicized for the severe delayed effects attributed to them, including cognitive decline, psychiatric disorders, seizures, impaired motor function, and personality changes. For convenience, the two afflictions are considered together under the rubric traumatic brain injury. Despite the need for neuroprotective agents, no substances have shown efficacy in clinical studies. Thus, a deeper understanding of the neuropathological mechanism of such injury is still needed. Proposed here is a theory that microorganisms from within the brain and elsewhere in the body contribute to the long-term neurological deterioration characteristic of traumatic brain injury. The label, ""The Beehive Theory"", is drawn from the well-known fact that disturbing a tranquil beehive with a blow can cause a swarm of angry bees to exit their dwelling place and attack nearby humans. Similarly, an impact to the head can initiate dislocations and disruptions in the microbiota present in the brain and body. First, since the normal human brain is not sterile, but is host to a variety of microorganisms, blows to the skull may dislodge them from their accustomed local environments, in which they have been living in quiet equilibrium with neighboring brain cells. Deleterious substances may be released by the displaced microbes, including metabolic products and antigens. Second, upon impact commensal microbes already resident on surfaces of the nose, mouth, and eyes, and potentially harmful organisms from the environment, may gain access to the brain through the distal ends of the olfactory and optic nerves or even a disrupted blood-brain barrier. Third, microbes dwelling in more distant parts of the body may be propelled through the walls of local blood vessels into the bloodstream, and then leak out into damaged areas of the brain that have increased blood-brain barrier permeability. Fourth, the impact may cause dysbiosis in the gastrointestinal microbiome, thereby disrupting signaling via the gut-brain axis. Possible preventatives or therapeutics that would address the adverse contributions of microbes to the late sequelae of traumatic brain injury include anti-inflammatories, antibacterials, antivirals, and probiotics.

2019-06-01,"Due largely to the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) and other explosives in recent military conflicts, blast-related TBI has emerged as a prominent injury sustained by warfighters. In the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been one of the most common types of injury sustained by soldiers and military personnel; of the ~380,000 TBIs reported in service members from 2000 to 2017, 82.3% were classified as mild (mTBI). While mTBI is associated with normal structural imaging, brief or no loss of consciousness, and rapid recovery of mental state, mTBI can nevertheless lead to persistent behavioral and cognitive effects. As in other cases of mTBI, exposure to low-level blast often does not cause immediate overt neurological effects, but may similarly lead to persistent behavioral and cognitive deficits. These effects are likely to be compounded when multiple exposures to blast and/or impact are sustained, since there is increasing evidence that multiple mTBIs can lead to chronic neurodegeneration. One common form of this deleterious outcome is frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), which is a progressive neurodegenerative process marked by atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, leading to frontotemporal dementia, a common form of dementia affecting behavior, cognition and language. About half of all cases of FTLD are marked by TAR-DNA binding protein (TDP-43)-positive protein inclusions. TDP-43, a DNA/RNA binding protein, controls the expression of thousands of genes and is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. TDP-43 abnormalities have also been associated with traumatic brain injury in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. The role of TDP-43 in the manifestation of FTLD pathology in military TBI cases is currently unclear, and to date there has been only a limited number of pre-clinical studies addressing the effects of repeated blast-related mild TBI (rbTBI) in relation to FTLD and TDP-43. This review will summarize some of these findings and address the concerns and critical knowledge gaps associated with FTLD manifestation with military populations, as well as clinical findings on other forms of mTBI.

2019-06-01,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein involved in the regulation of axonal microtubules in neurons. In pathological conditions, it forms fibrils that are molecular hallmarks of neurological disorders known as tauopathies. In the last 2 years, cryo-EM has given unprecedented high-resolution views of Tau in both physiological and pathological conditions. We review here these new findings and put them into the context of the knowledge about Tau before this structural breakthrough. The first structures of Tau fibrils, a molecular hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), were based on fibrils from the brain of an individual with AD and, along with similar patient-derived structures, have set the gold standard for the field. Cryo-EM structures of Tau fibers in three distinct diseases, AD, Pick's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, represent the end points of Tau's molecular trajectory. We propose that the recent Tau structures may call for a re-examination of databases that link different Tau variants to various forms of dementia. We also address the question of how this structural information may link Tau's functional and pathological aspects. Because this structural information on Tau was obtained in a very short period, the new structures should be viewed in light of earlier structural observations and past and present functional data to shed additional light on Tau function and dysfunction.

All participants in the former athletes group underwent diffusion tensor imaging to determine WM tract integrity and completed neuropsychological testing. We divided the former athletes group into those with normal (<300 pg/mL) and high (>300 pg/mL) CSF t-tau. CSF t-tau in the former athletes group was significantly higher than in the healthy control group (349.3 ± 182.6 vs 188.8 ± 39.9 pg/mL,  Our findings indicate that former athletes with multiple concussions are at increased risk of elevated levels of CSF t-tau and that high CSF t-tau is associated with reduced WM integrity and worse scores on the TMT Part B.

2019-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts. CTE has been linked to disruptions in cognition, mood, and behavior. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of CTE can only be made post-mortem. Neuropathological evidence suggests limbic structures may provide an opportunity to characterize CTE in the living. Using 3 T magnetic resonance imaging, we compared select limbic brain regional volumes - the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus - between symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players (n = 86) and controls (n = 22). Moreover, within the group of former NFL players, we examined the relationship between those limbic structures and neurobehavioral functioning (n = 75). The former NFL group comprised eighty-six men (mean age = 55.2 ± 8.0 years) with at least 12 years of organized football experience, at least 2 years of active participation in the NFL, and self-reported declines in cognition, mood, and behavior within the last 6 months. The control group consisted of men (mean age = 57.0 ± 6.6 years) with no history of contact-sport involvement or traumatic brain injury. All control participants provided neurobehavioral data. Compared to controls, former NFL players exhibited reduced volumes of the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus. Within the NFL group, reduced bilateral cingulate gyrus volume was associated with worse attention and psychomotor speed (r = 0.4 (right), r = 0.42 (left); both p < 0.001), while decreased right hippocampal volume was associated with worse visual memory (r = 0.25, p = 0.027). Reduced volumes of limbic system structures in former NFL players are associated with neurocognitive features of CTE. Volume reductions in the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus may be potential biomarkers of neurodegeneration in those at risk for CTE. "
2019-06-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is recognized as a global health problem due to its increasing occurrence, challenging treatment, and persistent impacts on brain pathophysiology. Neural cell death in patients with TBI swiftly causes inflammation in the injured brain areas, which is recognized as focal brain inflammation. Focal brain inflammation causes secondary brain injury by exacerbating brain edema and neuronal death, while also exerting divergent beneficial effects, such as sealing the damaged limitans and removing cellular debris. Recent evidence from patients with TBI and studies on animal models suggest that brain inflammation after TBI is not only restricted to the focal lesion but also disseminates to remote areas of the brain. The dissemination of inflammation has been detected within days after the primary injury and persists chronically. This state of inflammation may be related to remote complications of TBI in patients, such as hyperthermia and hypopituitarism, and may lead to progressive neurodegeneration, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Future studies should focus on understanding the mechanisms that govern the initiation and propagation of brain inflammation after TBI and its impacts on post-trauma brain pathology. "
2019-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a distinct neurodegenerative disease that associated with repetitive head trauma. CTE is neuropathologically defined by the perivascular accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein in the depths of the sulci in the cerebral cortices. In advanced CTE, hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposits are found in widespread regions of brain, however the mechanisms of the progressive neurodegeneration in CTE are not fully understood. In order to identify which proteomic signatures are associated with CTE, we prepared RIPA-soluble fractions and performed quantitative proteomic analysis of postmortem brain tissue from individuals neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE. We found that axonal guidance signaling pathwayrelated proteins were most significantly decreased in CTE. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis showed that axonal signaling pathway-related proteins were down regulated in neurons and oligodendrocytes and neuron-specific cytoskeletal proteins such as TUBB3 and CFL1 were reduced in the neuropils and cell body in CTE. Moreover, oligodendrocyte-specific proteins such as MAG and TUBB4 were decreased in the neuropils in both gray matter and white matter in CTE, which correlated with the degree of axonal injury and degeneration. Our findings indicate that deregulation of axonal guidance proteins in neurons and oligodendrocytes is associated with the neuropathology in CTE. Together, altered axonal guidance proteins may be potential pathological markers for CTE. "
2019-06-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by a head impact with a force exceeding regular exposure from normal body movement which the brain normally can accommodate. People affected include, but are not restricted to, sport athletes in American football, ice hockey, boxing as well as military personnel. Both single and repetitive exposures may affect the brain acutely and can lead to chronic neurodegenerative changes including chronic traumatic encephalopathy associated with the development of dementia. The changes in the brain following TBI include neuroinflammation, white matter lesions, and axonal damage as well as hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein. Even though the human brain gross anatomy is different from rodents implicating different energy transfer upon impact, especially rotational forces, animal models of TBI are important tools to investigate the changes that occur upon TBI at molecular and cellular levels. Importantly, such models may help to increase the knowledge of how the pathologies develop, including the spreading of tau pathologies, and how to diagnose the severity of the TBI in the clinic. In addition, animal models are helpful in the development of novel biomarkers and can also be used to test potential disease-modifying compounds in a preclinical setting. "

2019-05-01,"In the past decade, evidence has emerged suggesting a potential link between contact sport participation and increased risk of late neurodegenerative disease, in particular chronic traumatic encephalopathy. While there remains a lack of clear evidence to test the hypothesis that contact sport participation is linked to an increased incidence of dementia, there is growing public concern regarding the risk. There is, therefore, a pressing need for research to gain greater understanding of the potential risks involved in contact sports participation, and to contextualise these within holistic health benefits of sport. Football's InfluencE on Lifelong health and Dementia risk is designed as a retrospective cohort study, with the aim to analyse data from former professional footballers (FPF) in order to assess the incidence of neurodegenerative disease in this population. Comprehensive electronic medical and death records will be analysed and compared with those of a demographically matched population control cohort. As well as neurodegenerative disease incidence, all-cause, and disease-specific mortality, will be analysed in order to assess lifelong health. Cox proportional hazards models will be run to compare the data collected from FPFs to matched population controls. Approvals for study have been obtained from the University of Glasgow College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences Research Ethics Committee (Project Number 200160147) and from National Health Service Scotland's Public Benefits and Privacy Panel (Application 1718-0120).

2019-05-01,"A mechanism that describes the progression of traumatic brain injury (TBI) to end-stage chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is offered in this article. This mechanism is based upon the observed increase in the concentration of both tau protein and of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I proteins; the HLA increase is expressed on the cell membrane of neural cells. These events follow the inflammatory responses caused by the repetitive TBI. Associated inflammatory changes include macrophage entry into the brain parenchyma from increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and microglial activation at the base of the sulci. The release of interferon gamma from the microglia and macrophages induces the marked increased expression of HLA class I proteins by the neural cells and subsequent redistribution of the tau proteins to the glial and neuronal surface. In those individuals with highly expressed HLA class I C, the high level of HLA binds tau protein electrostatically. The ionic region of HLA class I C (amino acid positions 50-90) binds to the oppositely charged ionic region of tau (amino acid positions 93-133). These interactions thereby shift the cellular localization of the tau and orient the tau spatially so that the cross-linking sites of tau (275-280 and 306-311) are aligned. This alignment facilitates the cross-linking of tau to form the intracellular and extracellular microfibrils of tau, the primary physiological characteristic of tauopathy. Following endocytosis of the membrane HLA/tau complex, these microfibrils accumulate and produce a tau-storage-like disease. Therefore, tauopathy is the secondary collateral process of brain injury, resulting from the substantial increase in tau and HLA expression on neural cells. This proposed mechanism suggests several potential targets for mitigating the clinical progression of TBI to CTE. "
2019-05-01,"Concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a major public health concern, linked with persistent post-concussive syndrome, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. At present, standard clinical imaging fails to reliably detect traumatic axonal injury associated with concussion and post-concussive symptoms. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MR imaging technique that is sensitive to changes in white matter microstructure. Prior studies using DTI did not jointly investigate white matter microstructure in athletes, a population at high risk for concussive and subconcussive head traumas, with those in typical emergency room (ER) patients. In this study, we determine DTI scalar metrics in both ER patients and scholastic athletes who suffered concussions and compared them to those in age-matched healthy controls. In the early subacute post-concussion period, athletes demonstrated an elevated rate of regional decreases in axial diffusivity (AD) compared to controls. These regional decreases of AD were especially pronounced in the cerebellar peduncles, and were more frequent in athletes compared to the ER patient sample. The group differences may indicate differences in the mechanisms of the concussive impacts as well as possible compound effects of cumulative subconcussive impacts in athletes. The prevalence of white matter abnormality in cerebellar tracts lends credence to the hypothesis that post-concussive symptoms are caused by shearing of axons within an attention network mediated by the cerebellum, and warrant further study of the correlation between cerebellar DTI findings and clinical, neurocognitive, oculomotor, and vestibular outcomes in mTBI patients.

2019-05-01,"Tau-related dementias appear to involve specific to each disease aggregation pathways and morphologies of filamentous tau assemblies. To understand etiology of these differences, here we elucidate molecular mechanism of formation of tau PHFs based on the PMO theory of misfolding and aggregation of pleiomorphic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. In this model, fibrillization of tau is initiated by the coupled binding and folding of the MTB domains that yields antiparallel homodimers, in analogy to folding of split inteins. The free energy of binding is minimized when the antiparallel alignment brings about backbone-backbone H-bonding between the MTBD segments of similar ""strand"" propensities. To assess these propensities, a function of the NMR shielding tensors of the C "
2019-05-01,"Concussive traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the predominant type of brain injury in young adults and is a risk factor for the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases late in life. Using a repetitive closed head injury mouse model, we found that treatment with PF04457845, a novel fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor that selectively elevated the brain levels of anandamide, improved locomotor function, learning, and memory in TBI mice examined by beam walk, Y-maze, and Morris water maze tests. The accumulation of microglia and astrocytes and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), in the ipsilateral TBI mouse cortex and hippocampus were significantly reduced by drug treatment. The increased expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), phosphorylated Tau (p-Tau), phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (pGSK3β) and p35/p25 subunits and the decreased expression of the pre-synaptic proteins, synaptophysin, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP25), and cysteine string protein alpha (α-CSP), in TBI mouse brain were also normalized by PF04458745 treatment. The improved locomotor function and working memory were partially mediated by activation of both cannabinoid (CB)1 and CB2 receptors, whereas the improvement on spatial learning and memory seemed to be CB1 receptor dependent. Interestingly, the blockage of PF04457845 on the reduced expression of synaptophysin, but not SNAP25 and α-CSP, was reversed by coadministration of the CB1 receptor antagonist. These results suggest that the therapeutic effect of PF04457845 is mediated by both cannabinoid receptor dependent and independent mechanisms, and selective inhibition of FAAH possesses a great potential for the treatment of TBI.

2019-05-01,"The recent recognition that Alzheimer disease-like pathology may be found in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) even after acute mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) has increased the urgency of elucidating mechanisms, identifying biomarkers predictive of high risk of development of CTE, and establishing biomarker profiles indicative of impactful effects of treatments. Of the many proteins that are loaded into neuron-derived exosomes (NDEs) from damaged neurons after acute TBI, the levels of prion cellular protein (PRPc), coagulation factor XIII (XIIIa), synaptogyrin-3, IL-6, and aquaporins remain elevated for months. Prolonged heightened expression of aquaporins and IL-6 may account for the persistent central nervous system edema and inflammation of CTE. PRPc, XIIIa and synaptogyrin-3 bind and concentrate neurotoxic forms of oligomeric amyloid β peptides or P-tau for delivery into neurons at or distant from the site of trauma. Our progression factor hypothesis of CTE asserts that physiological neuronal proteins, such as PRPc, XIIIa, synaptogyrin-3, IL-6 and aquaporins, that increase in concentration in neurons and NDEs for months after acute TBI, are etiological contributors to CTE by either direct actions or by recruiting neurotoxic forms of Aβ peptides or P-tau. Such progression factors also may be useful new targets for development of drugs to prevent CTE. "
2019-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease that has been associated with a history of repetitive head impacts. The neuropathological diagnosis is based on a specific pattern of tau deposition with minimal amyloid-beta deposition that differs from other disorders, including Alzheimer's disease. The feasibility of detecting tau and amyloid deposition in the brains of living persons at risk for CTE has not been well studied. We used flortaucipir positron-emission tomography (PET) and florbetapir PET to measure deposition of tau and amyloid-beta, respectively, in the brains of former National Football League (NFL) players with cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms and in asymptomatic men with no history of traumatic brain injury. Automated image-analysis algorithms were used to compare the regional tau standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR, the ratio of radioactivity in a cerebral region to that in the cerebellum as a reference) between the two groups and to explore the associations of SUVR with symptom severity and with years of football play in the former-player group. A total of 26 former players and 31 controls were included in the analysis. The mean flortaucipir SUVR was higher among former players than among controls in three regions of the brain: bilateral superior frontal (1.09 vs. 0.98; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.20; P<0.001), bilateral medial temporal (1.23 vs. 1.12; adjusted mean difference, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.21; P<0.001), and left parietal (1.12 vs. 1.01; adjusted mean difference, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.20; P = 0.002). In exploratory analyses, the correlation coefficients in these three regions between the SUVRs and years of play were 0.58 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.79), 0.45 (95% CI, 0.07 to 0.71), and 0.50 (95% CI, 0.14 to 0.74), respectively. There was no association between tau deposition and scores on cognitive and neuropsychiatric tests. Only one former player had levels of amyloid-beta deposition similar to those in persons with Alzheimer's disease. A group of living former NFL players with cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms had higher tau levels measured by PET than controls in brain regions that are affected by CTE and did not have elevated amyloid-beta levels. Further studies are needed to determine whether elevated CTE-associated tau can be detected in individual persons. (Funded by Avid Radiopharmaceuticals and others.). "

2019-05-01,"This review recounts the definitions and research evidence supporting the multifaceted roles of neuroinflammation in the injured brain following trauma. We summarise the literature fluctuating from the protective and detrimental properties that cytokines, leukocytes and glial cells play in the acute and chronic stages of TBI, including the intrinsic factors that influence cytokine responses and microglial functions relative to genetics, sex, and age. We elaborate on the pros and cons that cytokines, chemokines, and microglia play in brain repair, specifically neurogenesis, and how such conflicting roles may be harnessed therapeutically to sustain the survival of new neurons. With a brief review of the clinical and experimental findings demonstrating early and chronic inflammation impacts on outcomes, we focus on the clinical conditions that may be amplified by neuroinflammation, ranging from acute seizures to chronic epilepsy, neuroendocrine dysfunction, dementia, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we provide an overview of the therapeutic agents that have been tested to reduce inflammation-driven secondary pathological cascades and speculate the future promise of alternative drugs. "
2019-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease thought to be caused by repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subconcussive injuries. While hyperphosphorylation of tau (p-Tau), which is attributed to astrocytic tangles (ATs) and neurofibrillary tangles, is known to be involved in CTE, there are limited neuropathological or molecular data. By utilizing repetitive mild TBI (rmTBI) mouse models, our aim was to examine the pathological changes of CTE-associated structures, specifically the ATs. Our rmTBI mouse models showed symptoms of depressive behavior and memory deficit, alongside an increased p-Tau expression in their neurons and astrocytes in both the hippocampus and cortex. rmTBI induced oxidative stress in endothelial cells and nitric oxide (NO) generation in astrocytes, which were mediated by hypoxia and increased hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF1α). There was also correlated decreased regional cerebral tissue perfusion units, mild activation of astrocytes and NFκB phosphorylation, increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling with decreased tetrahydrobiopterin, and increased expression of nitrotyrosine, NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2)/nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2) factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling proteins. Combined, these effects induced peroxynitrite formation and hyperphosphorylation of tau in the hippocampus and cortex toward the formation of ATs. Our model features molecular pathogenesis events of CTE with clinically relevant latency periods. In particular, this is the first demonstration of an increased astrocytic iNOS expression in an in vivo model. We propose a novel mechanism of uncoupled eNOS and NO contribution to Tau phosphorylation and AT formation in rmTBI brain, toward an increased molecular understanding of the pathophysiology of human CTE.

2019-05-01,"This study determined the prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and cortical aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) in a European community-based population (n = 310). The frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, representing initial stages of CTE were assessed. No case fulfilling CTE consensus criteria was found. However, isolated astroglial or neuronal tau pathologies were recognized in the depths of cortical sulci (<2%). A single case (female, 85 years) without a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) showed combined tau-immunoreactive features confined to frontal sulci without perivascular accumulation. Another 24 cases had single tau pathologies in cortical sulci. ARTAG was identified in 117 cases (38%), with a similar regional prevalence. Gray matter ARTAG was the most common followed by subpial, white matter, and perivascular. The presence of any type of ARTAG was strongly associated with having another type of ARTAG in the same region (p < 0.05). In summary, although isolated tau pathologies in the depths of cortical sulci were identified, no case fulfilled diagnostic criteria of CTE. Cortical ARTAG in this population is common and contrasts the high prevalence of CTE in individuals with repeated mild TBI. ARTAG in isolation might not be indicative of CTE although commonalities in pathogenesis should be considered. "

2019-02-01,"Brain injury arising from head trauma is a major concern in mixed martial arts (MMA) because knockout (KO) and technical knockout (TKO) are frequent fight outcomes. Previous studies have shown a high incidence of matches ending due to strikes to the head but did not consider weight categories and female fights. This study aimed at analyzing match stoppages in MMA and the exposure to head trauma distinguished by sex and weight categories. The heavier the weight class, the greater the risk and incidence of head trauma will be, regardless of sex. Descriptive epidemiology study. Level 3. Publicly available data of 167 MMA events from 1903 fights between 2014 and 2017 were assessed, comprising 8 male and 2 female weight categories. The combined KO/TKO rates per 100 athlete-exposures in the middleweight (19.53), light heavyweight (20.8), and heavyweight (26.09) divisions were greater than previously reported for MMA. While stoppage via KO/TKO occurred in 7.9% of combats in the female strawweight division, it occurred in 52.1% of the male heavyweight fights. The male middleweight ( P = 0.001), light heavyweight ( P < 0.001), and heavyweight divisions ( P < 0.001) had an increased risk of KO/TKO due to strikes to the head by 80%, 100%, and 206%, respectively. The risk in the flyweight division decreased 62% ( P = 0.001). All categories were compared with the lightweight division. The female bantamweight category presented a 221% increased risk in matches ending due to KO/TKO compared with the strawweight division ( P = 0.012). Punches to the head were the major technique used to end a combat via KO/TKO, regardless of sex and weight class. Head injury risk and incidence varies considerably according to sex and weight category in MMA. The analysis of head trauma exposure in MMA athletes should be distinguished according to sex and weight category. "
2019-04-01,"Pathological aggregation of the transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is associated with several neurodegenerative disorders, including ALS, frontotemporal dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. TDP-43 aggregation appears to be largely driven by its low-complexity domain (LCD), which also has a high propensity to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). However, the mechanism of TDP-43 LCD pathological aggregation and, most importantly, the relationship between the aggregation process and LLPS remains largely unknown. Here, we show that amyloid formation by the LCD is controlled by electrostatic repulsion. We also demonstrate that the liquid droplet environment strongly accelerates LCD fibrillation and that its aggregation under LLPS conditions involves several distinct events, culminating in rapid assembly of fibrillar aggregates that emanate from within mature liquid droplets. These combined results strongly suggest that LLPS may play a major role in pathological TDP-43 aggregation, contributing to pathogenesis in neurodegenerative diseases. "
2019-04-01,"Subconcussive hits pose a threat to neuronal health as they have shown to induce neuronal structural damage and functional impairment without causing outward symptomology and appear to be a key contributor to an irreversible neurodegenerative disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In addition, athletes can incur more than 1,000 of these hits per season. The subconcussive soccer heading model (SSHM) is a relevant, reproducible, and leading method of isolating and examining the effects of these subconcussive head impacts. By controlling variables such as ball traveling speed, the frequency of impacts, interval, ball placement to the head, as well as by measuring head impact magnitude, the SSHM provides the scientific community with a superior avenue of investigating the acute subconcussive effects on neuronal health. In this paper, we demonstrate the utility of SSHM in studying a time-course expression of neurofilament-light polypeptide (NF-L) in plasma in a repeated measures fashion. NF-L is an axonal injury marker that has previously been shown to be elevated in boxers and football players following subconcussive head trauma. Thirty-four adult aged soccer players were recruited and randomly assigned to either a soccer heading (n = 18) or kicking (n = 16) group. The heading group executed 10 headers with soccer balls projected at a velocity of 25 mph over 10 min. The kicking group followed the same protocol with 10 kicks. Plasma samples were obtained before and at 0 h, 2 h, and 24 h after heading/kicking and assessed for NF-L expressions. The heading group showed a gradual increase in plasma NF-L expression and peaked at 24 h after the heading protocol, whereas the kicking group remained consistent across the time points. These results confirmed the NF-L data from clinical field studies, encouraging the use of SSHM to validate clinical subconcussion data. "
2019-04-01,"Repeated mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI) can potentially manifest into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The apolipoprotein E (APOE4) genotype, a well-recognized potent genetic risk factor in age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, has been linked to worse outcome after TBI in individuals who carry this allele. The underlying molecular modifications triggered by APOE genotype following r-mTBI remain elusive. We addressed the influence of APOE genotype on TBI dependent tau pathology in middle-aged mice. Using a previously established experimental mTBI protocol in a new repetitive injury paradigm, we report the pathological changes that occurred following one-month of repetitive injuries in APOE3/4 gene targeted mice. Firstly, pathological assessment demonstrated evidence of microgliosis and astrogliosis in the corpus callosum of injured animals, but there was no APOE dependent genotype effect on injury. However, in the parietal cortex Iba1-immunoreactivity was significantly increased in injured versus sham APOE3 mice, but not in APOE4 mice. No effects were observed in soluble amyloid levels with injury or interaction with genotype. APOE4 mice showed significant increases in the tau conformational marker MC1, neurofilament H, brain phospholipids, and endothelial specific oxidized low density lipoprotein receptor in cortical homogenates obtained from injured mice compared to sham counterparts. This pilot work suggests APOE3 and APOE4 specific effects following injury in a mouse model of r-mTBI. These changes may underlie the molecular changes that trigger the vulnerability and increased risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases in aged individuals exposed to repetitive mTBI. "
2019-04-01,"Measurements of dynamic deformation of the human brain, induced by external harmonic vibration of the skull, were analyzed to illuminate the mechanics of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Shear wave propagation velocity vector fields were obtained to illustrate the role of the skull and stiff internal membranes in transmitting motion to the brain. Relative motion between the cerebrum and cerebellum was quantified to assess the vulnerability of connecting structures. Mechanical deformation was quantified throughout the brain to investigate spatial patterns of strain and axonal stretch. Strain magnitude was generally attenuated as shear waves propagated into interior structures of the brain; this attenuation was greater at higher frequencies. Analysis of shear wave propagation direction indicates that the stiff membranes (falx and tentorium) greatly affect brain deformation during imposed skull motion as they serve as sites for both initiation and reflection of shear waves. Relative motion between the cerebellum and cerebrum was small in comparison with the overall motion of both structures, which suggests that such relative motion might play only a minor role in TBI mechanics. Strain magnitudes and the amount of axonal stretch near the bases of sulci were similar to those in other areas of the cortex, and local strain concentrations at the gray-white matter boundary were not observed. We tentatively conclude that observed differences in neuropathological response in these areas might be due to heterogeneity in the response to mechanical deformation rather than heterogeneity of the deformation itself.

2019-04-01,"Alzheimer disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) involve the abnormal accumulation in the brain of filaments composed of both three-repeat (3R) and four-repeat (4R) (3R/4R) tau isoforms. To probe the molecular basis for AD's tau filament propagation and to improve detection of tau aggregates as potential biomarkers, we have exploited the seeded polymerization growth mechanism of tau filaments to develop a highly selective and ultrasensitive cell-free tau seed amplification assay optimized for AD (AD real-time quaking-induced conversion or AD RT-QuIC). The reaction is based on the ability of AD tau aggregates to seed the formation of amyloid fibrils made of certain recombinant tau fragments.

2019-04-01,"The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic yield of computed tomography (CT) of the brain for the investigation of psychosis. CT brain requests describing psychosis over a 7-year period at a 500-bed major metropolitan hospital were identified retrospectively. Patients were excluded if they were aged greater than 50 years or if the CT request described focal neurological findings on examination, trauma/falls or known brain tumour, demyelinating disorder, encephalopathy, seizure disorder, congenital brain anomaly, stroke or traumatic brain injury. A total of 805 patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria were identified, representing the largest published study on this topic. Only 0.4% of patients (3 out of 805) had a potential cause for psychosis demonstrated on CT. None of these patients had their management altered as a result. An additional 0.6% of patients (5 out of 805) had significant pathology that was deemed unrelated to their psychosis. The diagnostic value of CT in the setting of psychosis was found to be extremely low in patients meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Given the risk of ionising radiation and the expenditure of time and cost, more judicious use of CT is suggested. "
2019-04-01,"Concussion is defined as a complex pathophysiological process that affects the brain as a result of traumatic biomechanical forces. Repeated unrecovered concussions can result in chronic brain injury syndrome which is referred to in the literature today as chronic traumatic encephalopathy."" There is an exponential increase in public and political interest in this condition in the recent times resulting in a significant investment in research to improve the current understanding of the disease, ways to decrease its incidence and determine its prognosis. Broadly the research involves three main disciplines of medicine including neuropathology, neuroradiology and biological markers. Although progress has been made, to date there is no definite pathological, radiological or neurobiological marker which has shown consistent promise to make the diagnosis and prognosticate the disease. Possible reasons are multiple such as inconsistencies in the methods studies have used, different time periods in which the tests were conducted, the small numbers of subjects included in the studies, and inconsistencies in the definitions of concussion or mild traumatic brain injury. Herein, we present a comprehensive review of the current literature on this topic.

2019-04-01,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest neurodegenerative disease and the most frequent cause of dementia. It affects 30 million people worldwide. Current research criteria focus on biomarkers' status for amyloid and tau using positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid analysis, independent of clinical status. Current epidemiological data, which mostly rely on biomarker-undetermined AD cases, have highlighted ApoE4 and age as the main risk factors. Rare autosomal dominant mutations also account for a small fraction of early-onset AD. The main clinical phenotype at presentation is the amnestic phenotype targeting episodic memory. This is followed by rarer phenotypes such as posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia, frontal variant AD, corticobasal syndrome, and other even rarer presentations mimicking language variants of frontotemporal dementia. Main differential diagnoses include hippocampal sclerosis with TDP-43, primary age-related tauopathy, argyrophilic grain disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Lewy body disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy as well as nondegenerative disorders such as cerebrovascular disease, chronic alcohol consumption, limbic encephalitis, medial temporal lobe epilepsy, and others. Co-occurrence of AD pathology with other neurodegenerative and vascular diseases is common and increases with age. This presents a challenge in current clinical practice due to a lack of reliable biomarkers for non-AD neurodegenerative diseases. "

2019-03-01,"[F-18]-MK-6240, a novel tau positron emission tomography (PET) tracer recently discovered for the in vivo detection of neurofibrillary tangles, has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy in the detection of Alzheimer disease. We have examined regional and substrate-specific binding patterns as well as possible off-target binding of this tracer on human brain tissue to advance towards its validation. We applied [F-18]-MK-6240 phosphor screen and high resolution autoradiography to postmortem samples from patients with a definite pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-tau (Pick's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration), chronic traumatic encephalopathy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration-Tar DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), dementia with Lewy bodies, cerebral amyloid angiopathy and elderly controls free of pathologic changes of neurodegenerative disease. We also directly compared the binding properties of [F-18]-MK-6240 and [F-18]-AV-1451 in human tissue, and examined potential nonspecific binding of both tau tracers to monoamine oxidases (MAO) by using autoradiography in the presence of selective monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) and monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors. Our data indicate that MK-6240 strongly binds to neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer disease but does not seem to bind to a significant extent to tau aggregates in non-Alzheimer tauopathies, suggesting that it may have a limited utility for the in vivo detection of these pathologies. There is no evidence of binding to lesions containing β-amyloid, α-synuclein or TDP-43. In addition, we identified MK-6240 strong off-target binding to neuromelanin and melanin-containing cells, and some weaker binding to areas of hemorrhage. These binding patterns are nearly identical to those previously reported by our group and others for [F-18]-AV-1451. Of note, [F-18]-MK-6240 and [F-18]-AV-1451 autoradiographic binding signals were only weakly displaced by competing concentrations of selective MAO-B inhibitor deprenyl but not by MAO-A inhibitor clorgyline, suggesting that MAO enzymes do not appear to be a significant binding target of any of these two tracers. Together these novel findings provide relevant insights for the correct interpretation of in vivo [F-18]-MK-6240 PET imaging. "
2019-03-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for a group of neurodegenerative diseases termed tauopathies, which includes Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Although TBI is stratified by impact severity as either mild (m), moderate or severe, mTBI is the most common and the most difficult to diagnose. Tauopathies are pathologically related by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (P-tau) and increased total tau (T-tau). Here we describe: (i) a novel human tau-expressing transgenic mouse model, TghTau/PS1, to study repetitive mild closed head injury (rmCHI), (ii) quantitative comparison of T-tau and P-tau from brain and plasma in TghTau/PS1 mice over a 12 month period following rmCHI (and sham), (iii) the usefulness of P-tau as an early- and late-stage blood-based biochemical biomarker for rmCHI, (iii) the influence of kinase-targeted therapeutic intervention on rmCHI-associated cognitive deficits using a combination of lithium chloride (LiCl) and R-roscovitine (ros), and (iv) correlation of behavioral and cognitive changes with concentrations of the brain and blood-based T-tau and P-tau. Compared to sham-treated mice, behavior changes and cognitive deficits of rmCHI-treated TghTau/PS1 mice correlated with increases in both cortex and plasma T-tau and P-tau levels over 12 months. In addition, T-tau, but more predominantly P-tau, levels were significantly reduced in the cortex and plasma by LiCl + ros approaching the biomarker levels in sham and drug-treated sham mice (the drugs had only modest effects on the T-tau and P-tau levels in sham mice) throughout the 12 month study period. Furthermore, although we also observed a reversal of the abnormal behavior and cognitive deficits in the drug-treated rmCHI mice (compared to the untreated rmCHI mice) throughout the time course, these drug-treated effects were most pronounced up until 10 and 12 months where the abnormal behavior and cognition deficits began to gradually increase. These studies describe: (a) a translational relevant animal model for TBI-linked tauopathies, and (b) utilization of T-tau and P-tau as rmCHI biomarkers in plasma to monitor novel therapeutic strategies and treatment regimens for these neurodegenerative diseases.

2019-03-01,"The long-term neurologic consequences of exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) are not well understood. This study used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to examine later-life neurochemistry and its association with RHI and clinical function in former National Football League (NFL) players. The sample included 77 symptomatic former NFL players and 23 asymptomatic individuals without a head trauma history. Participants completed cognitive, behavior, and mood measures. N-acetyl aspartate, glutamate/glutamine, choline, myo-inositol, creatine, and glutathione were measured in the posterior (PCG) and anterior (ACG) cingulate gyrus, and parietal white matter (PWM). A cumulative head impact index (CHII) estimated RHI. In former NFL players, a higher CHII correlated with lower PWM creatine (r = -0.23, p = 0.02). Multivariate mixed-effect models examined neurochemical differences between the former NFL players and asymptomatic individuals without a history of head trauma. PWM N-acetyl aspartate was lower among the former NFL players (mean diff. = 1.02, p = 0.03). Between-group analyses are preliminary as groups were recruited based on symptomatic status. The ACG was the only region associated with clinical function, including positive correlations between glutamate (r = 0.32, p = 0.004), glutathione (r = 0.29, p = 0.02), and myo-inositol (r = 0.26, p = 0.01) with behavioral/mood symptoms. Other positive correlations between ACG neurochemistry and clinical function emerged (i.e., behavioral/mood symptoms, cognition), but the positive directionality was unexpected. All analyses controlled for age, body mass index, and education (for analyses examining clinical function). In this sample of symptomatic former NFL players, there was a direct effect between RHI and reduced cellular energy metabolism (i.e., lower creatine). MRS neurochemicals associated with neuroinflammation also correlated with behavioral/mood symptoms. "
2019-03-01,"Repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked to late life development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disorder histopathologically characterized by perivascular tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau at the depth of sulci to later widespread neurofibrillary pathology. Although tau hyperphosphorylation and neurofibrillary-like pathology have been observed in the brain of transgenic mice overexpressing human tau with aggregation-prone mutation after TBI, they have not been consistently recapitulated in rodents expressing wild-type tau only. Here, we characterized Alzheimer-like alterations behaviorally, biochemically and immunohistochemically 6 weeks and 7 months after unilateral mild-to-moderate controlled cortical impact (CCI) in 5-7-month-old Tg/htau mice, which express all six isoforms of non-mutated human tau in a mouse tau null background. We detected hyperphosphorylation of tau at multiple sites in ipsilateral hippocampus 6 weeks but not 7 months after CCI. However, neuronal accumulation of AT8 positive phospho-tau was sustained in the chronic phase, in parallel to prolonged astrogliosis, and decreased neural and synaptic markers. The mice with CCI also exhibited cognitive and locomotor impairment. These results indicate subacute to chronic Alzheimer-like alterations after CCI in Tg/htau mice. This is the first known study providing insight into the role of CCI in Alzheimer-like brain alterations in young adult mice expressing only non-mutated human tau. "
2019-03-01,"When participating in contact sports, (mild) head trauma is a common incident-observed in both professional and amateur sports. When head trauma results in transient neurological impairment, a sports-related concussion has occurred. Acute concussion, repetitive concussions, as well as cumulative ""sub-concussive"" head impacts may increase the risk of developing cognitive and behavioral deficits for athletes, as well as accelerated cerebral degeneration. While this concept has been well established for classic contact sports like American Football, Rugby, or Boxing, there is still an awareness gap for the role of sports-related concussion in the context of the world's most popular sport-Soccer. Here, we review the relevance of sport-related concussion for Soccer as well as its diagnosis and management. Finally, we provide insight into future directions for research in this field. Soccer fulfills the criteria of a contact sport and is characterized by a high incidence of concussion. There is ample evidence that these events cause functional and structural cerebral disorders. Furthermore, heading, as a repeat sub-concussive impact, has been linked to structural brain changes and neurocognitive impairment. As a consequence, recommendations for the diagnosis and management of concussion in soccer have been formulated by consensus groups. In order to minimize the risk of repetitive concussion in soccer the rapid and reliable side-line diagnosis of concussion with adoption of a strict remove-from-play protocol is essential, followed by a supervised, graduated return-to-play protocol. Recent studies, however, demonstrate that adherence to these recommendations by players, coaches, clubs, and officials is insufficient, calling for stricter enforcement. In addition, future research to solidify the pathophysiological relevance of concussion for soccer athletes seems to be needed. Advanced neuroimaging and neurochemical biomarker analyses (e.g. S100β, tau and neurofilament light (NfL)) may assist in detecting concussion-related structural brain changes and selecting athletes at risk for irreversible damage. Sports-related concussion represents a genuine neurosurgical field of interest. Given the high socioeconomic relevance, neurosurgeons should get involved in prevention and management of concussion in soccer. "

2019-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative condition characterized by the perivascular deposition of phosphorylated τ (p-τ) protein aggregates resulting from repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rTBI). Advances in the field have revealed the significance of repetitive head trauma in the pathogenesis of CTE in contact sports as well as military veterans. In this study we provide evidence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption in regions of intense perivascular p-τ deposition in a former professional boxer diagnosed with CTE and schizophrenia. P-τ deposition was associated with loss of the tight junction protein claudin-5 and enhanced extravasation of endogenous blood components such as fibrinogen and IgG. We also provide evidence of tight junction disruption in individuals with schizophrenia, with discontinuous claudin-5 immunoreactivity in the parietal cortex. This data highlights a common phenotype of a dysfunctional BBB in individuals with CTE and schizophrenia and may represent a novel correlate of neural dysfunction in individuals at risk of developing CTE and schizophrenia. .

2019-03-01,"Due to the unmet need for a means to study chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in vivo, there have been numerous efforts to develop an animal model of this progressive tauopathy. However, there is currently no consensus in the field on an injury model that consistently reproduces the neuropathological and behavioral features of CTE. We have implemented a repetitive Closed-Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration (CHIMERA) injury paradigm in human transgenic (hTau) mice. Animals were subjected to daily subconcussive or concussive injuries for 20 days and tested acutely, 3 months, and 12 months post-injury for deficits in social behavior, anxiety, spatial learning and memory, and depressive behavior. Animals also were assessed for chronic tau pathology, astrogliosis, and white matter degeneration. Repetitive concussive injury caused acute deficits in Morris water maze performance, including reduced swimming speed and increased distance to the platform during visible and hidden platform phases that persisted during the subacute and chronic time-points following injury. We found evidence of white matter disruption in animals injured with subconcussive and concussive injuries, with the most severe disruption occurring in the repetitive concussive injury group. Severity of white matter disruption in the corpus callosum was moderately correlated with swimming speed, while white matter disruption in the fimbria showed weak but significant correlation with worse performance during probe trial. There was no evidence of tau pathology or astrogliosis in sham or injured animals. In summary, we show that repetitive brain injury produces persistent behavioral abnormalities as late as 1 year post-injury that may be related to chronic white matter disruption, although the relationship with CTE remains to be determined.

2019-03-01,"Mild blast traumatic brain injury is commonly prevalent in modern combat casualty care and has been associated with the development of neurodegenerative conditions. However, whether primary lower level blast overpressure (LBOP) causes neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation remains largely unknown. The aim of our present study was to determine whether LBOP can cause neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Anesthetized rats were randomly assigned to LBOP group (70 kPa, n = 5) or sham group (without blast, n = 5). Histopathological and cytokine changes in brain tissue at 5 days post-injury were evaluated by hematoxylin-eosin staining and Bioplex assay, respectively. Histopathological assessment revealed neuronal degeneration and increased density of inflammatory cells in frontal and parietal cortex, hippocampus and thalamus in rats exposed to LBOP. LBOP exposure significantly elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (EPO, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12, IL-18, and TNF-α) and chemokines (GRO and RANTES) as well as of an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-13) in the frontal cortex. This study reveals a role of neuroinflammation in neurodegeneration after mild blast traumatic brain injury. Therapies that target this process might in warfighters might function either by attenuating the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease, or by slowing their progression.

2019-03-01,"The term chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has recently entered public consciousness via media reports and even a Hollywood movie. However, in contrast to general impressions, the incidence of CTE is unknown, the clinical diagnostic criteria have not been agreed upon and the current neuropathological characterization of CTE is acknowledged as preliminary. Additionally, few studies have compared the pathologies of CTE with those of other neurodegenerative disorders or of age-matched controls. Consequently, disagreement continues about the neuropathological aspects that make CTE unique. Furthermore, CTE is widely considered to be a consequence of exposure to repeated head blows, but evidence suggests that a single moderate or severe traumatic brain injury can also induce progressive neuropathological changes. These unresolved aspects of CTE underlie disparate claims about its clinical and pathological features, leading to confusion among the public and health-care professionals alike. "
2019-03-01,"An observational study to compare the laminar distributions in frontal and temporal cortex of the tau-immunoreactive pathologies in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC). Post-mortem material of (1) four cases of CTE without ADNC, (2) seven cases of CTE with ADNC (CTE/ADNC), and (3) seven cases of ADNC alone. In CTE and CTE/ADNC, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuropil threads (NT), and dot-like grains (DLG) were distributed either in upper cortex or across all layers. Low densities of astrocytic tangles (AT) and abnormally enlarged neurons (EN) were not localized to any specific layer. Surviving neurons exhibited peaks of density in both upper and lower cortex, and vacuole density was greatest in superficial layers. In ADNC, neuritic plaques (NP) were more frequent, AT rare, NFT and NT were more widely distributed, NT affected lower layers more frequently, and surviving neurons were less frequently bimodal than in CTE and CTE/ADNC. Tau pathology in CTE and CTE/ADNC consistently affected the upper cortex but was more widely distributed in ADNC. The presence of CTE may encourage the development of ADNC pathology later in the course of the disease. "
2019-03-01,"Three decades of animal studies have reproducibly shown that hypothermia is profoundly cerebroprotective during or after a central nervous system (CNS) insult. The success of hypothermia in preclinical acute brain injury has not only fostered continued interest in research on the classic secondary injury mechanisms that are prevented or blunted by hypothermia but has also sparked a surge of new interest in elucidating beneficial signaling molecules that are increased by cooling. Ironically, while research into cold-induced neuroprotection is enjoying newfound interest in chronic neurodegenerative disease, conversely, the scope of the utility of therapeutic hypothermia (TH) across the field of acute brain injury is somewhat controversial and remains to be fully defined. This has led to the era of Targeted Temperature Management, which emphasizes a wider range of temperatures (33-36°C) showing benefit in acute brain injury. In this comprehensive review, we focus on our current understandings of the novel neuroprotective mechanisms activated by TH, and discuss the critical importance of developmental age germane to its clinical efficacy. We review emerging data on four cold stress hormones and three cold shock proteins that have generated new interest in hypothermia in the field of CNS injury, to create a framework for new frontiers in TH research. We make the case that further elucidation of novel cold responsive pathways might lead to major breakthroughs in the treatment of acute brain injury, chronic neurological diseases, and have broad potential implications for medicines of the distant future, including scenarios such as the prevention of adverse effects of long-duration spaceflight, among others. Finally, we introduce several new phrases that readily summarize the essence of the major concepts outlined by this review-namely, Ultramild Hypothermia, the ""Responsivity of Cold Stress Pathways,"" and ""Hypothermia in a Syringe.""

2019-02-01,"Tau pathology associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy has been documented in the brains of individuals with a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI). At this stage, the pathobiological role of tau in r-mTBI has not been extensively explored in appropriate pre-clinical models. Here, we describe the acute and chronic behavioral and histopathological effects of single and repetitive mild TBI (five injuries given at 48 h intervals) in young adult (3 months old) hTau mice that express all six isoforms of hTau on a null murine tau background. Animals exposed to r-mTBI showed impaired visuospatial learning in the Barnes maze test that progressively worsened from two weeks to 12 months post-injury, which was also accompanied by significant deficits in visuospatial memory consolidation at 12 months post-injury. In contrast, only marginal changes were observed in visuospatial learning at six and 12 months after single mTBI. Histopathological analyses revealed that hTau mice developed axonal injury, thinning of the corpus callosum, microgliosis and astrogliosis in the white matter at acute and chronic time points after injury. Tau immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay data suggest, however, only transient, injury-dependent increases in phosphorylated tau in the cerebral cortex beneath the impact site and in the CA1/CA3 subregion of the hippocampus after single or r-mTBI. This study implicates white matter degeneration as a prominent feature of survival from mTBI, while the role of tau pathology in the neuropathological sequelae of TBI remains elusive. "

2019-02-01,"This article provides a discussion on the current state of knowledge of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with an emphasis on clinical features and emerging biomarkers of the condition. The results of several large brain bank case series among subjects with a history of contact sports or repetitive head trauma have indicated that a high frequency of CTE may exist in this population. However, the true prevalence of CTE among individuals with a history of head trauma remains unknown, given that individuals who experienced cognitive, behavioral, and mood symptoms during life are more likely to have their brains donated for autopsy at death and epidemiologic studies of the condition are lacking. Neuropathologic consensus criteria have been published. Research-based clinical criteria have been proposed and are beginning to be applied, but the definitive diagnosis of CTE in a living patient remains impossible without effective biomarkers for the condition, which is an active area of study. The field of CTE research is rapidly growing and parallels many of the advances seen for other neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer disease decades ago. "
2019-02-01,"OBJECTIVERecent research demonstrates that victims of spinal cord injury (SCI) are at increased risk for dementia and that encephalitis can occur as a consequence of isolated SCI. We theorize that autoimmunity to the central nervous system (CNS) could explain these phenomena and undertook this study to determine whether peripheral inoculation with spinal cord homogenate on 1 or 2 occasions is associated with CNS-directed autoimmunity and neurodegeneration in a rat model.METHODSRats were subcutaneously inoculated with saline or 75 mg of allogeneic spinal cord tissue on 1 or 2 occasions. Animals underwent Morris Water Maze testing, and serial serum samples were collected. Animals were sacrificed 8 weeks following the first inoculation. Autoantibody titers to myelin antigens MAG and GM1 were measured in serum. Immunohistochemistry was used to identify autoantibodies targeting NeuN-labeled neurons and CC1-labeled oligodendrocytes. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blotting were performed for pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 and the cell death marker caspase 3 as well as the neurodegenerative proteins tau and β-amyloid in both brain and spinal cord. Fluoro-Jade B was used to stain degenerating neurons, facilitating counting.RESULTSAnimals inoculated with spinal cord homogenate exhibited increased titers of autoantibodies to MAG and GM1 and autoantibodies binding to neurons and oligodendrocytes. Double-inoculated animals demonstrated a significant increase in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brain (TNF-α, p = 0.016; IL-6, p = 0.009) as well as the spinal cord (TNF-α, p = 0.024; IL-6, p = 0.002). The number of degenerating neurons was significantly increased in the brain and spinal cord of inoculated animals (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.028, respectively). Elevated expression of tau and β-amyloid was seen in brain of double-inoculated animals (p = 0.003 and p = 0.009, respectively). Inflammatory marker expression in the brain was positively correlated with anti-myelin autoimmune antibody titers and with tau expression in the brain. Inoculated animals showed impaired memory function in Morris Water Maze testing (p = 0.043).CONCLUSIONSThe results of these experiments demonstrate that peripheral exposure to spinal cord antigens is associated with CNS-directed autoimmunity and inflammation in the brain and spinal cord as well as degeneration of CNS cells, memory impairment, and production of neurodegenerative proteins particularly when this exposure is repeated. These data support CNS autoimmunity as a candidate mechanism for the dementia that can follow SCI and perhaps other posttraumatic dementias such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. "
2019-02-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a risk factor for development of chronic neurodegenerative disorders later in life. This review summarizes the current knowledge and concepts regarding the connection between long-term consequences of TBI and aging-associated neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and Parkinsonism, with implications for novel therapy targets. Several aggregation-prone proteins such as the amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides, tau proteins, and α-synuclein protein are involved in secondary pathogenic cascades initiated by a TBI and are also major building blocks of the hallmark pathological lesions in chronic human neurodegenerative diseases with dementia. Impaired metabolism and degradation pathways of aggregation-prone proteins are discussed as potentially critical links between the long-term aftermath of TBI and chronic neurodegeneration. Utility and limitations of previous and current preclinical TBI models designed to study the link between TBI and chronic neurodegeneration, and promising intervention pharmacotherapies and non-pharmacologic strategies to break this link, are also summarized. Complexity of long-term neuropathological consequences of TBI is discussed, with a goal of guiding future preclinical studies and accelerating implementation of promising therapeutics into clinical trials.

2019-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was first discovered in professional boxers after they exhibited memory impairments, mood and behavioral changes after years of boxing. However, there is now a growing acceptance that CTE can develop in athletes of other sports due to the repetitive head trauma they receive. We present a case of a middle-aged male who presented with worsening memory, poor concentration, and behavioral changes for a year. On further cognitive testing, it was revealed that he had difficulties with short-term memory and processing speed as well as difficulties in organizing and multitasking. He had been practicing mixed martial arts (MMA) for 10 years, and later was an instructor of the sport. Through a detailed examination of his history, it was discovered that he sustained recurrent minor head concussions due to his line of work. To date, there has been limited large-scale research on head trauma in MMA. There is thus an urgent need for more studies in this area as CTE can be a chronic and debilitating illness with incapacitating neuropsychiatric sequelae. This case highlights the importance of public awareness of the risks of MMA and the dangers it poses to the brain, especially with more young people being attracted to this sport. "
2019-01-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has had increased notoriety in light of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in professional sports. However, despite the increased rate at which mood disorders affect this population, there remains little information on management of these disorders. TBI has also been implicated in the development of Parkinson disease, increasing the likelihood that patients may be treated with dopaminergic agents. Management of coexisting pathologies can become challenging, especially when confounded by medication side effects. A case is presented of a 58-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital in a manic state 15 years after having suffered a closed head injury. Several psychiatric admissions during the past 2 years were noted, with various diagnoses including different iterations of bipolar disorder. Among his medications, levodopa-carbidopa was present for an unsubstantiated Parkinson disease diagnosis. His mania resolved after discontinuation of the agent. This case is presented with a review of the relevant literature pertaining to the use of levodopa-carbidopa in this context, the use of other dopaminergic agents, and a biological hypothesis for the potential increased likelihood of manic symptoms in TBI patients who receive levodopa-carbidopa. Currently, there is a lack of research in this area, which emphasizes a need to review treatment guidelines for Parkinson disease patients with TBI. "
2019-01-01,"In the context of neurodegeneration and aging, the cerebellum is an enigma. Genetic markers of cellular aging in cerebellum accumulate more slowly than in the rest of the brain, and it generates unknown factors that may slow or even reverse neurodegenerative pathology in animal models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Cerebellum shows increased activity in early AD and Parkinson's disease (PD), suggesting a compensatory function that may mitigate early symptoms of neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Perhaps most notably, different parts of the brain accumulate neuropathological markers of AD in a recognized progression and generally, cerebellum is the last brain region to do so. Taken together, these data suggest that cerebellum may be resistant to certain neurodegenerative mechanisms. On the other hand, in some contexts of accelerated neurodegeneration, such as that seen in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) following repeated traumatic brain injury (TBI), the cerebellum appears to be one of the most susceptible brain regions to injury and one of the first to exhibit signs of pathology. Cerebellar pathology in neurodegenerative disorders is strongly associated with cognitive dysfunction. In neurodegenerative or neurological disorders associated with cerebellar pathology, such as spinocerebellar ataxia, cerebellar cortical atrophy, and essential tremor, rates of cognitive dysfunction, dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms increase. When the cerebellum shows AD pathology, such as in familial AD, it is associated with earlier onset and greater severity of disease. These data suggest that when neurodegenerative processes are active in the cerebellum, it may contribute to pathological behavioral outcomes. The cerebellum is well known for comparing internal representations of information with observed outcomes and providing real-time feedback to cortical regions, a critical function that is disturbed in neuropsychiatric disorders such as intellectual disability, schizophrenia, dementia, and autism, and required for cognitive domains such as working memory. While cerebellum has reciprocal connections with non-motor brain regions and likely plays a role in complex, goal-directed behaviors, it has proven difficult to establish what it does mechanistically to modulate these behaviors. Due to this lack of understanding, it's not surprising to see the cerebellum reflexively dismissed or even ignored in basic and translational neuropsychiatric literature. The overarching goals of this review are to answer the following questions from primary literature: When the cerebellum is affected by pathology, is it associated with decreased cognitive function? When it is intact, does it play a compensatory or protective role in maintaining cognitive function? Are there theoretical frameworks for understanding the role of cerebellum in cognition, and perhaps, illnesses characterized by cognitive dysfunction? Understanding the role of the cognitive cerebellum in neurodegenerative diseases has the potential to offer insight into origins of cognitive deficits in other neuropsychiatric disorders, which are often underappreciated, poorly understood, and not often treated.

2019-01-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability worldwide, with mild TBI (mTBI) accounting for 85% of cases. mTBI is also implicated in serious long-term sequelae including second impact syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. mTBI often goes undiagnosed due to delayed symptom onset and limited sensitivity of conventional assessment measures compared with severe TBI. Current efforts seek to identify accurate and reliable non-invasive biomarkers associated with functional measures relevant to long-term outcomes. Here we evaluated the utility of serum and salivary microRNAs (miRNAs) to serve as sensitive and specific peripheral biomarkers of possible mTBI. Our primary objectives were to establish the relationship between peripheral measures of miRNA, objective quantification of head impacts, and sensitive indices of balance and cognitive function in healthy young adult athletes. A secondary objective was to compare the sensitivity of miRNA versus commonly used blood-based protein biomarkers. 50 amateur mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters participated. 216 saliva and serum samples were collected at multiple time points, both pre- and post-fight. Levels of 10 serum proteins were compared in a subset of the fighters (n = 24). Levels of miRNAs were obtained by next generation sequencing. Functional outcomes were evaluated using a computerized assessment system that measured cognitive performance, body sway, and combined cognitive performance and body sway during dual task completion. Data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression for predictive classification, analysis of variance, correlation analysis and principal component analysis. We identified a subset of salivary and serum miRNAs that showed robust utility at predicting TBI likelihood and demonstrated quantitative associations with head impacts as well as cognitive and balance measures. In contrast, serum proteins demonstrated far less utility. We also found that the timing of the responses varies in saliva and serum, which is a critical observation for biomarker studies to consider. "
2019-01-01,"Subjective complaints of dizziness after mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury are common. Alterations in the mode of injury have changed the presentation symptoms. Evolutions in neuroimaging challenge conventional concepts regarding lack of evidence of injury following mild head trauma and provide hope for elucidating the site of lesion in patients with post-traumatic balance symptoms. Yet the vestibular clinician must maintain a healthy level of suspicion regarding potential exaggeration of symptoms and disability in patients with a financial incentive. Unique conditions warrant particular attention by the vestibular clinician, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, catastrophization, and persistent postural and perceptual dizziness. The clinical significance of abnormalities, particularly on vestibular-evoked myogenic potential testing, needs to be better defined prior to their widespread application in the medical legal arena. The role of the medical expert is to provide opinion on matters requiring special knowledge to assist the court in reaching its findings. As such, this chapter provides an update on recent advances to consider in patients with dizziness after trauma. "

2020-02-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI). Although described in boxers for almost a century, scientific and public interest in CTE grew tremendously following a report of postmortem evidence of CTE in the first former professional American football player in 2005. Neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for CTE have been defined, with abnormal perivascular deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau at the sulcal depths as the pathognomonic feature. CTE can currently only be diagnosed postmortem, but clinical research criteria for the in vivo diagnosis of CTE have been proposed. The clinical phenotype of CTE is still ill-defined and there are currently no validated biomarkers to support an in-life diagnosis of ""Probable CTE."" Many knowledge gaps remain regarding the neuropathologic and clinical make-up of CTE. An increased understanding of CTE is critical given the millions that could potentially be impacted by this disease. This chapter describes the state of the literature on CTE. The historical origins of CTE are first presented, followed by a comprehensive description of the neuropathologic and clinical features. The chapter concludes with discussion on future research directions, emphasizing the importance of diagnosing CTE during life to facilitate development of preventative and intervention strategies. "
2019-11-01,"In addition to neurodegenerative disorders, there are many secondary forms of parkinsonism. The most common cause for secondary parkinsonism is the intake of distinct drugs. Neuroleptics and calcium channel blockers have been mainly described to induce parkinsonism, but also other drugs were suspected to cause or worsen parkinsonism. Another common cause for secondary parkinsonism are vascular lesions (i.e. vascular parkinsonism). Furthermore, also brain tumors have been described as rare causes for parkinsonism. Moreover, parkinsonism can be caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is a special case, since secondary insults to the brain leads to the occurrence of a neuropathologically defined disease. Other rare causes for secondary parkinsonism are lesions caused by infectious or immunological diseases as well as toxins or street drugs. "
2019-10-01,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) have received widespread media attention in recent years as being a risk factor for the development of dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This has sparked fears about the potential long-term effects of TBI of any severity on cognitive aging, leading to a public health concern. This article reviews the evidence surrounding TBI as a risk factor for the later development of changes in brain structure and function, and an increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders. A number of studies have shown evidence of long-term brain changes and accumulation of pathological biomarkers (e.g., amyloid and tau proteins) related to a history of moderate-to-severe TBI, and research has also demonstrated that individuals with moderate-to-severe injuries have an increased risk of dementia. While milder injuries have been found to be associated with an increased risk for dementia in some recent studies, reports on long-term brain changes have been mixed and often are complicated by factors related to injury exposure (i.e., number of injuries) and severity/complications, psychiatric conditions, and opioid use disorder. CTE, although often described as a neurodegenerative disorder, remains a neuropathological condition that is poorly understood. Future research is needed to clarify the significance of CTE pathology and determine whether that can explain any clinical symptoms. Overall, it is clear that most individuals who sustain a TBI (particularly milder injuries) do not experience worse outcomes with aging, as the incidence for dementia is found to be less than 7% across the literature.

2019-11-01,"Given the increasing rate of death by suicide in the United States, it is imperative to examine specific risk factors and to identify possible etiologies of suicidal behavior in at-risk clinical subpopulations. There is accumulating evidence to support an elevated risk of death by suicide in individuals with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this review article, after defining terms used in suicidology, we discuss the associations of TBI with death by suicide, suicide attempt, and suicidal ideation. A model for repetitive TBIs, leading to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is also discussed as a neuroinflammatory process, with discussion about its possible link with suicide. The review concludes with an overview of interventions to prevent suicidal behavior. "
2020-02-01,"This work critically reviews chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with a specific focus on the single criterion necessary and sufficient for diagnosis. Herein, CTE is compared to other well-established neurodegenerative entities including Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. Each neurodegenerative disorder is reviewed in five pertinent areas: 1) historical perspective, 2) guideline formation process, 3) clinical diagnostic criteria, 4) pathological diagnostic criteria, and 5) validation of previously described diagnostic criteria (e.g., sensitivity and specificity). These comparisons indicate that CTE is a disease in the earliest stages of formation and has yet to undergo rigorous development and refinement similar to other neurodegenerative diseases. Suggested future revisions to the diagnostic criterion of CTE include establishing a lower threshold for accumulation of pathology, as well as accounting for the presence of concomitant neuropathology and comorbid neurodegenerative disorders. Currently, while initial efforts have been attempted, agreed upon antemortem clinical criteria do not exist. As has been the scientific standard with similar neurodegenerative disorders, antemortem diagnostic guidelines should first be refined through subcommittees of neuroscientists from diverse institutional backgrounds with a subclassification of levels of diagnostic certainty (possible, probably, and definite). Validation studies should then assess the predictive value and accuracy of proposed antemortem diagnostic criteria in relation to potential pathological criteria. "
2020-02-01,"It is presently unknown whether military service members are at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, due to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Studies with respect to AD have had mixed results with respect to mild TBI, although an increased risk of clinical AD with moderate and severe TBI is more consistently demonstrated. No studies to date have demonstrated a longitudinal progression from TBI to autopsy. We therefore initiated a cross-sectional survey of former military service members. 18 brain specimens have been examined to date, with a mean age of 68.9±16 years (range 32-94). Twelve had a history of psychiatric problems; 10 had a history of PTSD specifically. Five had neurological problems including stroke and seizures. One subject had early-onset AD. Two subjects had a history of TBI and two had a history of blast exposure. Age-related proteinopathy, ranging from AD neuropathologic change A0B1C0 to A3B3C3 by NIA-AA guidelines, was identified. None of the cases showed changes specific for CTE pathology. There was no relationship between p-tau in the amygdala and psychiatric signs. There was no significant difference in phosphorylated tau (p-tau) or amyloid-β burden compared to age-matched controls. These preliminary data suggest that military service per se is not a risk factor for CTE pathology or neurodegenerative proteinopathy. More research is needed to study the relationship, if any, between TBI and neurodegenerative proteinopathy. "
2020-02-01,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative brain injury that has become prevalent among high-contact professional sports, especially American football. More and more retired players are exhibiting symptoms of CTE and being diagnosed with CTE post-mortem. While the neuroscience community constantly releases studies showing a causal connection between brain trauma and CTE, the National Football League (NFL) continues to deny that any brain injury can arise from playing football. The NFL must implement provisions in their contracts to fully inform and protect players from this lethal brain injury. This article examines the repercussions of CTE, how players' contracts do and do not provide protections, and the possible provisions the NFL can implement in its contracts to adequately protect players of repeated brain trauma.

2019-12-01,"This Note examines the NCAA's unwillingness to enforce the requirement that all NCAA institutions must implement a concussion management plan; the NCAA's refusal to apply its appropriate enforcement mechanism when member institutions violate their concussion management plans, which are instituted in order to protect student-athletes from concussions; how both of these failures result in more concussions and a higher probability of debilitating long-term effects; and solutions to remedy this grave injustice. Part II describes what a concussion is, the long-term effects of concussions, the NCAA's management of concussions, and lawsuits challenging the NCAA in relation to concussions. Part III analyzes the inefficiencies of the NCAA in its management of concussions, the previous and current lawsuits' failure to stimulate change within the NCAA, and the proposed solutions that will help create a safe environment for student-athletes.

2019-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease that is found in people who have suffered from chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI). Up to now, diagnosis of CTE could only be made based on postmortem histopathological examinations. The application of MR techniques might offer a promising possibility for in vivo diagnoses. To provide a critical systematic review of the characterization of chronic TBI and CTE by considering the range of MR techniques. This was a systematic review for which the electronic databases PubMed and Embase were searched using the terms (""chronic traumatic encephalopathy"" OR ""punch drunk syndrome"" OR ""chronic traumatic brain injury"" OR ""dementia pugilistica"" OR ""chronic head trauma"") AND (""magnetic resonance imaging"" OR mri OR imaging OR mrs OR ""magnetic resonance spectroscopy"" OR spectroscopy). Of the 432 studies identified by the database search, 25 were included in this review. Diffusion, structural, and functional MRI sequences and MR spectroscopy were evaluated at 1.5T or 3T and at 11.74T for the ex vivo studies. Data were extracted by two reviewers independently. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria like the study design, publication type, and applied MR techniques were used to select studies for review. Results of the original research articles were stated in this review as significant if P ≤ 0.05. Of the included articles, two were ex vivo studies focusing on the coregistration of histology and MRI. All other studies were based on in vivo data. The included studies varied considerably regarding study setup, MR techniques, and results. Nevertheless, this work aims to establish links between the studies and discusses the results and limitations associated with the characterization of chronic TBI and CTE based on MR. 3 Technical Efficacy: Stage 2 J.

2019-10-01,"To characterize individual and group-level neuroimaging findings in patients at risk for Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). Eleven male patients meeting criteria for Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES, median age: 64) underwent neurologic evaluation, 3-Tesla MRI, and PET with [ All patients with TES sustained repetitive head injury participating in impact sports, ten in American football. Three patients met criteria for dementia and eight had mild cognitive impairment. Two patients were amyloid-PET positive and harbored the most severe MRI atrophy, FDG hypometabolism, and FTP-tau PET binding. Among the nine amyloid-negative patients, tau-PET showed either mildly elevated frontotemporal binding, a ""dot-like"" pattern, or no elevated binding. Medial temporal FTP was mildly elevated in a subset of amyloid-negative patients, but values were considerably lower than in AD. Voxelwise analyses revealed a convergence of imaging abnormalities (higher FTP binding, lower FDG, lower gray matter volumes) in frontotemporal areas in TES compared to controls. Mildly elevated tau-PET binding was observed in a subset of amyloid-negative patients at risk for CTE, in a distribution consistent with CTE pathology stages III-IV. FTP-PET may be useful as a biomarker of tau pathology in CTE but is unlikely to be sensitive to early disease stages. "

2019-08-01,"There are growing genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic data pointing to the complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Unbiased ""omics"" approaches are essential for the future development of effective AD research, which will need to be combined and personalized, given that multiple distinct pathways can drive AD pathology. It is essential to gain a better understanding of the AD pathogenesis subtype variety and to develop several distinct therapeutic approaches tailored to address this diversity, as well as the common presence of mixed pathologies. These nonmutually exclusive therapeutic approaches include the targeting of multiple toxic oligomeric species concurrently, targeting the apolipoprotein E/amyloid β interaction and the modulation of innate immunity, as well as more ""out of the box"" ideas such as targeting infectious agents that may play a role in AD.

2020-02-01,"This chapter describes the main neuropathological features of the most common age associated neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body diseases, vascular dementia and the various types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. In addition, the more recent concepts of primary age-related tauopathy and ageing-related tau astrogliopathy as well as chronic traumatic encephalopathy are briefly described. One section is dedicated to cerebral multi-morbidity as it is becoming increasingly clear that the old brain is characterised by the presence of multiple pathologies (to varying extent) rather than by one single, disease specific pathology alone. The main aim of this chapter is to inform the reader about the neuropathological basics of age associated neurodegenerative diseases as we feel this is crucial to meaningfully interpret the vast literature that is published in the broad field of dementia research.

2020-01-01,"Article is devoted to topical issues of complex diagnosis and treatment of the consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in children, adolescents and adults. Craniocerebral trauma is one of the most important problems of modern neurology, due to the high frequency and severity of disability. In recent years, there has been a steady increase in effects of TBI, a significant part of which are asthenic, autonomic, cognitive, emotional and motor disorders. Factors affecting the severity of the consequences of TBI are: the severity of the injury, the age, at which the injury occurred, the time elapsed since the injury, the localization of the lesion. After mild TBI, the structure of cognitive impairment is dominated by memory and attention disorders (75%), visual-motor coordination, as well as asthenic disorders (88%), chronic headaches (95%). After moderate and severe TBI, there are more pronounced impairment of cognitive and motor functions accompanied by pathological neurological symptoms in 94-100% of children, which leads to difficulties in learning, self-service and has a negative impact on social adaptation. The article describes in detail the modern methods of complex diagnosis, as well as pathogenetically justified methods of drug therapy of cognitive disorders in patients with the consequences of TBI. The high efficacy of the modern cytoprotective drug Cytoflavin in the treatment of the effects of TBI is shown. Статья посвящена актуальным вопросам комплексной диагностики и лечения последствий черепно-мозговой травмы (ЧМТ) у детей, подростков и взрослых пациентов. ЧМТ является одной из наиболее важных проблем современной неврологии ввиду высокой частоты и тяжести инвалидизации. В последние годы отмечается неуклонный рост последствий ЧМТ, значительную часть которых составляют астенические, вегетативные, когнитивные, эмоциональные и двигательные нарушения. Факторами, влияющими на выраженность последствий ЧМТ, являются тяжесть, возраст, в котором произошла травма, время, прошедшее с момента травмы, локализация поражения. После легкой ЧМТ в структуре когнитивных нарушений преобладают нарушения памяти и внимания (у 75%), зрительно-моторной координации, а также астенические расстройства (у 88%), хронические головные боли (у 95%). После среднетяжелой и тяжелой ЧМТ отмечаются более выраженные нарушения когнитивных и двигательных функций, сопровождающиеся патологической неврологической симптоматикой у 94-100% детей, что приводит к трудностям обучения, самообслуживания и негативно сказывается на социальной адаптации в целом. В статье подробно освещены современные методы комплексной диагностики, а также патогенетически обоснованные способы медикаментозной терапии когнитивных расстройств у больных с последствиями ЧМТ.

2018-12-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) consists of acute and long-term pathophysiological sequelae that ultimately lead to cognitive and motor function deficits, with age being a critical risk factor for poorer prognosis. TBI has been recently linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases later in life including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and multiple sclerosis. The accumulation of iron in the brain has been documented in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, and also in normal aging, and can contribute to neurotoxicity through a variety of mechanisms including the production of free radicals leading to oxidative stress, excitotoxicity and by promoting inflammatory reactions. A growing body of evidence similarly supports a deleterious role of iron in the pathogenesis of TBI. Iron deposition in the injured brain can occur via hemorrhage/microhemorrhages (heme-bound iron) or independently as labile iron (non-heme bound), which is considered to be more damaging to the brain. This review focusses on the role of iron in potentiating neurodegeneration in TBI, with insight into the intersection with neurodegenerative conditions. An important implication of this work is the potential for therapeutic approaches that target iron to attenuate the neuropathology/phenotype related to TBI and to also reduce the associated risk of developing neurodegenerative disease.

2018-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI). CTE is generally found in athletes participating in contact sports and military personnel exposed to explosive blasts but can also affect civilians. Clinically and pathologically, CTE overlaps with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a term mostly used in a clinical context. The histopathology of CTE is defined by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in neurons and astrocytes preferentially with perivascular distribution and at the depths of the cortical sulci. In addition to hyperphosphorylated tau, other pathologic proteins are deposited in CTE, including amyloid β (Aβ), transactive response (TAR) DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP-43) and α-synuclein. However, the coexistence of prion disease in CTE has not been observed. We report three cases of histopathologically validated CTE with co-existing sporadic prion disease. Two were identified in a cohort of 55 pathologically verified cases of CTE submitted to the CTE Center of Boston University. One was identified among brain tissues submitted to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center of Case Western Reserve University. The histopathological phenotype and properties of the abnormal, disease-related prion protein (PrP "

Focus groups conducted with Massachusetts School Nurses in 2015 found that some had applied protocols required in the state's sports concussion regulations to all students with concussion, not just student athletes. We surveyed high school nurses in Massachusetts to examine (1) the extent of this practice and (2) the extent to which protocols for all students with concussion are included in school policies. Of 168 (74%) responding, 94% applied the return-to-learn and play, and medical clearance requirements to all students with concussion, regardless of how or where the concussion occurred and 77% reported their school's policy required these protocols for all students with concussion. A significant association (odds ratio: 13.3, 95% confidence interval [2.4, 72.8], p <.01) existed between the two measures. These findings have important clinical and academic implications. "
2018-12-01,"Changes to retina have been reported after a number of neurodegenerative conditions. The purpose of this study was to investigate retinal structures in Olympic boxers exposed to frequent head blows. Retinal imaging offers potential as a non-invasive biomarker of neuropathology. Macula and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in UK Olympic boxers attending two mandatory eye screening programs, 18 months apart. Data from the two eye screenings provide longitudinal data of retinal change over time. Sedentary healthy subjects (controls) without past or present history of concussion were also screened at the time of the second boxer screening to provide comparison of cross-sectional data. Sixteen Olympic boxers aged 20-33 years and 20 sedentary healthy controls, aged 24-45 years, were recruited. Significant macula thickening was observed over time (18 months) in 75% of right and 50% of left eye sectors. For RNFL, left eye quadrants thickened. For right eye RNFL quadrants, thickening and thinning of this layer were observed. Cross-sectional results showed thinner macula sectors and RNFL quadrants in Olympic boxers compared to controls. Significant change to macula and RNFL densities, occurring over an 18 month interval is an unexpected finding in otherwise heathy elite sportsmen. In addition, macula and RNFL were thinner than healthy sedentary controls. OCT may prove clinically useful as a candidate retinal biomarker of neuropathological change after mild traumatic brain injury and/or repeat head blows. "
2018-12-01,"Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a risk factor for the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy typified by immunoreactive tau aggregates in the depths of the sulci. However, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms involved have not been largely explored. Phospholipids are important molecules which form membrane lipid bilayers; they are ubiquitous to every cell in the brain, and carry out a host of different functions. Imbalance in phospholipid metabolism, signaling and transport has been documented in some neurological conditions. However, not much is currently known about their roles in repetitive mTBI and how this may confer risk for the development of age-related neurodegenerative diseases. To address this question, we designed a longitudinal study (24 h, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-injury) to comprehensively investigate mTBI dependent brain phospholipid profiles compared to sham counterparts. We use our established mouse model of repetitive mTBI that has been extensively characterized up to 1-year post-injury in humanized tau (hTau) mice, which expresses all six human tau isoforms, on a null murine background. Our data indicates a significant increase in sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and derivative lysoPE and lysoPC at acute and/or sub-acute time points post-injury within the cortex and hippocampus. There was also a parallel increase at early time points in monounsaturated, polyunsaturated and saturated fatty acids. Omega-6 (arachidonic acid) to omega-3 (docosahexaenoic acid) fatty acid ratio for PE and PC species was increased also at 24 h and 3 months post-injury in both hippocampus and cortex. The long-term consequences of these early changes in phospholipids on neuronal and non-neuronal cell function is unclear, and warrants further study. Understanding phospholipid metabolism, signaling and transport following TBI could be valuable; they may offer novel targets for therapeutic intervention not only in TBI but other neurodegenerative diseases.

2018-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated head traumas. Using immunohistochemistry for glial fibrillary acidic protein as a marker, plus automated quantitative analysis, we examined the characteristics and extent of astrogliosis present in stage III and IV CTE, along with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) cases. Astrogliosis in CTE patients was more diffuse compared to that of AD and FTD patients, which was concentrated in the sulcal depths. Of 14 patients with CTE, 10 exhibited signs of a degenerating astrocyte pathology, characterized by beaded, broken astrocytic processes. This astrocytic degeneration was typically found to be diffuse throughout the white matter, although two cases demonstrated astrocytic degeneration in the gray matter. The degeneration was also observed in 2 of 3 AD and 2 of 3 FTD brains, with overall similar characteristics across diseases. There was minimal to no astrocytic degeneration in six age-matched controls with no neurodegenerative disease. We found that the extent of the white matter astrocytic degeneration was strongly correlated with the level of overall astrogliosis in both the white and gray matter. However, astrocytic degeneration was not correlated with the overall extent of tau pathology. Specifically, there was no correlation between levels of p-tau in the sulcal depths and astrocytic degeneration in the white matter adjacent to the sulcal depths. Thus, astrocytic degeneration and overall astrogliosis appear to represent distinct pathological features of CTE. Further investigation into these astroglial pathologies could provide new insights into underlying disease mechanisms and represent a potential target for in vivo assessment of CTE as well as other neurodegenerative disorders.

2018-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder linked to repetitive head impacts and has been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal, degenerative neuromuscular disorder. The Department of Veterans Affairs Biorepository Brain Bank (VABBB) is a tissue repository that collects antemortem disease progression data and postmortem central nervous system tissue from veterans with ALS. We set out to determine the frequency of co-morbid ALS and CTE in the VABBB cohort and to characterize the clinical, genetic, and pathological distinctions between participants with ALS only and those with both ALS and CTE (ALS+CTE). Of 155 participants, 9 (5.8%) had neuropathologically confirmed ALS+CTE. Participants with ALS+CTE were more likely to have a history of traumatic brain injury (p < 0.001), served during the first Persian Gulf War (p < 0.05), and to have more severe tau pathology within the frontal cortex and spinal cord (p < 0.05). The most common exposures to head impacts included contact sports (n = 5) and military service (n = 2). Clinically, participants with ALS+CTE were more likely to have bulbar onset ALS (p = 0.006), behavioral changes (p = 0.002), and/or mood changes (p < 0.001). Overall, compared with ALS in isolation, comorbid ALS+CTE is associated with a history of TBI and has a distinct clinical and pathological presentation. "
2018-11-01,"The diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury or sports-related concussion is a challenge for all clinicians, players, coaches and parents involved in contact sports. Currently, there is no validated objective biomarker available to assess the presence or severity of concussion in sport, and so it is necessary to rely on subjective measures like self-reporting of symptoms which depend on the cooperation of the athlete. There is a significant health risk associated with repetitive injury if the diagnosis is missed, and so there is great value in an objective biomarker to assist diagnostic and prognostic decisions. To establish a panel of non-invasive MicroRNA biomarkers in urine and saliva for the rapid diagnosis of sports-related concussion and investigate the kinetics and clinical utility of these biomarkers in assisting diagnostic, prognostic and return-to-play decisions.

Professional rugby players in the two highest tiers of senior professional domestic rugby competition in England will be recruited prospectively to the study. During the season, three groups will be identified: athletes entering the World Rugby Head Injury Assessment (HIA) protocol, uninjured control athletes and control athletes with musculoskeletal injuries. Saliva and urine will be collected from these athletes at multiple timepoints, coinciding with key times in the HIA protocol and return-to-play process. Ethics approval has been obtained. The compiled and analysed results will be presented at national and international conferences concerning the care of patients with traumatic brain injury.

2018-11-01,"The genetic basis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is poorly understood. Variation in transmembrane protein 106B (TMEM106B) has been associated with enhanced neuroinflammation during aging and with TDP-43-related neurodegenerative disease, and rs3173615, a missense coding SNP in TMEM106B, has been implicated as a functional variant in these processes. Neuroinflammation and TDP-43 pathology are prominent features in CTE. The purpose of this study was to determine whether genetic variation in TMEM106B is associated with CTE risk, pathological features, and ante-mortem dementia. Eighty-six deceased male athletes with a history of participation in American football, informant-reported Caucasian, and a positive postmortem diagnosis of CTE without comorbid neurodegenerative disease were genotyped for rs3173615. The minor allele frequency (MAF = 0.42) in participants with CTE did not differ from previously reported neurologically normal controls (MAF = 0.43). However, in a case-only analysis among CTE cases, the minor allele was associated with reduced phosphorylated tau (ptau) pathology in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) (AT8 density, odds ratio [OR] of increasing one quartile = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.22-0.79, p = 0.008), reduced neuroinflammation in the DLFC (CD68 density, OR of increasing one quartile = 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.98, p = 0.043), and increased synaptic protein density (β = 0.306, 95% CI 0.065-0.546, p = 0.014). Among CTE cases, TMEM106B minor allele was also associated with reduced ante-mortem dementia (OR = 0.40, 95% CI 0.16-0.99, p = 0.048), but was not associated with TDP-43 pathology. All case-only models were adjusted for age at death and duration of football play. Taken together, variation in TMEM106B may have a protective effect on CTE-related outcomes. "

2018-11-01,"There is growing public concern about neurodegenerative changes (e.g., Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy) that may occur chronically following clinically apparent and clinically silent (i.e., sub-concussive blows) pediatric mild traumatic brain injury (pmTBI). However, there are currently no biomarkers that clinicians can use to objectively diagnose patients or predict those who may struggle to recover. Non-invasive neuroimaging, electrophysiological and neuromodulation biomarkers have promise for providing evidence of the so-called ""invisible wounds"" of pmTBI. Our systematic review, however, belies that notion, identifying a relative paucity of high-quality, clinically impactful, diagnostic or prognostic biomarker studies in the sub-acute injury phase (36 studies on unique samples in 28 years), with the majority focusing on adolescent pmTBI. Ultimately, well-powered longitudinal studies with appropriate control groups, as well as standardized and clearly-defined inclusion criteria (time post-injury, injury severity and past history) are needed to truly understand the complex pathophysiology that is hypothesized (i.e., still needs to be determined) to exist during the acute and sub-acute stages of pmTBI and may underlie post-concussive symptoms.

2018-11-01,"There is increasing societal concern about the long-term effects of repeated impacts from soccer heading, but there is little information about ways to reduce head impact severity. The purpose of this study was to identify factors that contribute to head acceleration during soccer heading. One-hundred soccer players completed 12 controlled soccer headers. Peak linear (PLA) and rotational (PRA) accelerations were measured using a triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope. Head acceleration contributing factors were grouped into 3 categories: size (head mass, neck girth), strength (sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezius) and technique [kinematics (trunk, head-to-trunk range-of-motion), sternocleidomastoid and upper trapezius activity]. Multiple regression analyses indicated size variables explained 22.1% of the variance in PLA and 23.3% of the variance in PRA; strength variables explained 13.3% of the variance in PLA and 17.2% of the variance in PRA; technique variables did not significantly predict PLA or PRA. These findings suggest that head and neck size and neck strength predict PLA and PRA. Anthropometric and neck strength measurements should be considered when determining an athlete's readiness to begin soccer heading. "
2018-10-01,"Neurological therapeutics have been hampered by its inability to advance beyond symptomatic treatment of neurodegenerative disorders into the realm of actual palliation, arrest or reversal of the attendant pathological processes. While cannabis-based medicines have demonstrated safety, efficacy and consistency sufficient for regulatory approval in spasticity in multiple sclerosis (MS), and in Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut Syndromes (LGS), many therapeutic challenges remain. This review will examine the intriguing promise that recent discoveries regarding cannabis-based medicines offer to neurological therapeutics by incorporating the neutral phytocannabinoids tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), their acidic precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), and cannabis terpenoids in the putative treatment of five syndromes, currently labeled recalcitrant to therapeutic success, and wherein improved pharmacological intervention is required: intractable epilepsy, brain tumors, Parkinson disease (PD), Alzheimer disease (AD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI)/chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE).

2018-10-01,"Background and objectives One method of mitigating global increases in dementia prevalence involves assessing public knowledge and then educating laypeople. We measured knowledge of late-life pathological cognitive decline in a diverse, international sample using a standardized, validated instrument. We assessed 3619 international respondents recruited through Amazon's Mechanical Turk with a 44-item dementia knowledge survey and 18 sociodemographic items. Results Results suggested that the following sociodemographic variables are associated with less overall knowledge: young age, male gender, low educational attainment, born in a developing nation, of ethnic minority status, not married, and less prior dementia experience. Specific knowledge gaps emerged in cerebrovascular disease, delirium versus dementia, treatment of behavioral dementia symptoms, Alzheimer's disease genetics, Parkinson's disease symptoms, and characteristics of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and subjective cognitive decline. Discussion and implications: Findings may facilitate effective multinational dementia education initiatives by providing specific recommendations as to which sociodemographic populations and content knowledge domains will benefit the most from limited resources.

Tau also plays an important role as an axonal microtubule protein. Tau is an amazing protein that plays a key role in cognitive processes, however, deposits of abnormal forms of tau are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer disease (AD), the most prevalent, and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), the most recently associated to abnormal tau. Tau post-translational modifications (PTMs) are responsible for its gain of toxic function. Alonso et al. (1996) were the first to show that the pathological tau isolated from AD brains has prion-like properties and can transfer its toxic function to the normal molecule. Furthermore, we reported that the pathological changes are associated with tau phosphorylation at Ser199 and 262 and Thr212 and 231. This pathological version of tau induces subcellular mislocalization in cultured cells and neurons, and translocates into the nucleus or accumulated in the perinuclear region of cells. We have generated a transgenic mouse model that expresses pathological human tau (PH-Tau) in neurons at two different concentrations (4% and 14% of the total endogenous tau). In this model, PH-Tau causes cognitive decline by at least two different mechanisms: one that involves the cytoskeleton with axonal disruption (at high concentration), and another in which the apparent neuronal morphology is not grossly affected, but the synaptic terminals are altered (at lower concentration). We will discuss the putative involvement of tau in proteostasis under these conditions. Understanding tau's biological activity on and off the microtubules will help shed light to the mechanism of neurodegeneration and of normal neuronal function. "
2018-10-01,"Most neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the accumulation of protein aggregates, some of which are toxic to cells. Mounting evidence demonstrates that in several diseases, protein aggregates can pass from neuron to neuron along connected networks, although the role of this spreading phenomenon in disease pathogenesis is not completely understood. Here we briefly review the molecular and histopathological features of protein aggregation in neurodegenerative disease, we summarize the evidence for release of proteins from donor cells into the extracellular space, and we highlight some other mechanisms by which protein aggregates might be transmitted to recipient cells. We also discuss the evidence that supports a role for spreading of protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis and some limitations of this model. Finally, we consider potential therapeutic strategies to target spreading of protein aggregates in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. "

2018-10-01,"Sport-related concussion is a common form of mild traumatic brain injury that is now recognised as a serious health issue. Growing evidence suggests concussion may result in long-term and severe neurological disabilities. Recent research into the diagnosis and management of concussion may provide new approaches to concussion management that limit the potential long-term adverse effects of concussion. This paper summarises the problem of sport-related concussion and reviews key factors (sex, age, genetics) that may modify concussion outcomes. Current sport-related concussion tools are described. Analysis of emerging methods of acute concussion diagnosis using objective fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers is provided. These new concussion biomarkers have the potential to change management of sport-related concussion. "
2018-10-01,"Athletes, military personnel and mobility-declined elderly people are prone to repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI). The injury does not cause acute pathological changes, but leads to chronic neurodegeneration, long-term cognitive dysfunction and even chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Many existing rmTBI animal models reported uncontrollable adverse effects and long experiment period. Therefore, an improved model needs to be designed. Our rmTBI mouse model is a modification of the closed head injury method using electronic controlled cortical impact system. Discontinuous 4 impacts with 48-h interval were performed. A key facet of the model is the use of our designed molded acrylic cast and concave metal disc (as a helmet). They could scatter and transmit hitting power to the whole brain, thus produced a mild diffused injury. The procedure does not require scalp incision or craniotomy, which allows the impacting to be completed in 2 min. Our model did not induce acute macroscopic brain damage and brain edema. It could lead to sustained neuroinflammation and chronic neurodegeneration in injured brain, and resulted in cognitive dysfunction within 5 weeks post-injury. Previously reported adverse effects including skull fractures, hemorrhage and brain tissue loss were not observed in our model. An experiment period of 5 weeks was allowed for observing chronic neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. Our model is beneficial to use for simplicity, reproducibility and time saver. It could serve as a platform for research on the pathogenesis, diagnosis and potential therapeutics for rmTBI and CTE. "
2018-10-01,"The neuroimmune system is involved in development, normal functioning, aging, and injury of the central nervous system. Microglia, first described a century ago, are the main neuroimmune cells and have three essential functions: a sentinel function involved in constant sensing of changes in their environment, a housekeeping function that promotes neuronal well-being and normal operation, and a defense function necessary for responding to such changes and providing neuroprotection. Microglia use a defined armamentarium of genes to perform these tasks. In response to specific stimuli, or with neuroinflammation, microglia also have the capacity to damage and kill neurons. Injury to neurons in Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and prion diseases, as well as in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, results from disruption of the sentinel or housekeeping functions and dysregulation of the defense function and neuroinflammation. Pathways associated with such injury include several sensing and housekeeping pathways, such as the Trem2, Cx3cr1 and progranulin pathways, which act as immune checkpoints to keep the microglial inflammatory response under control, and the scavenger receptor pathways, which promote clearance of injurious stimuli. Peripheral interference from systemic inflammation or the gut microbiome can also alter progression of such injury. Initiation or exacerbation of neurodegeneration results from an imbalance between these microglial functions; correcting such imbalance may be a potential mode for therapy. "
2018-10-01,"A substantial number of individuals have long-lasting adverse effects from a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Depression is one of these long-term complications that influences many aspects of life. Depression can limit the ability to return to work, and even worsen cognitive function and contribute to dementia. The mechanistic cause for the increased depression risk associated with a TBI remains to be defined. As TBI results in chronic neuroinflammation, and priming of glia to a secondary challenge, the inflammatory theory of depression provides a promising framework for investigating the cause of depression following a TBI. Increases in cytokines similar to those seen in depression in the general population are also increased following a TBI. Biomarker levels of cytokines peak within hours-to-days after the injury, yet pro-inflammatory cytokines may still be elevated above physiological levels months-to-years following TBI, which is the time frame in which post-TBI depression can persist. As tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1 can signal directly at the neuronal synapse, pathophysiological levels of these cytokines can detrimentally alter neuronal synaptic physiology. The purpose of this review is to outline the current evidence for the inflammatory hypothesis of depression specifically as it relates to depression following a TBI. Moreover, we will illustrate the potential synaptic mechanisms by which tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1 could contribute to depression. The association of inflammation with the development of depression is compelling; however, in the context of post-TBI depression, the role of inflammation is understudied. This review attempts to highlight the need to understand and treat the psychological complications of a TBI, potentially by neuroimmune modulation, as the neuropsychiatric disabilities can have a great impact on the rehabilitation from the injury, and overall quality of life.

2018-09-01,"Repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries (rmTBI) are associated with cognitive deficits, inflammation, and stress-related events. We tested the effect of nutrient intake on the impact of rmTBI in an animal model of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this model. We used a between group design rmTBI closed head injuries in mice, compared to a control and nutrient-treated groups. Our model allows for controlled, repetitive closed head impacts to mice. Briefly, 24-week-old mice were divided into five groups: control, rmTBI, and rmTBI with nutrients (2% of NF-216, NF-316 and NF-416). rmTBI mice received four concussive impacts over 7 days. Mice were treated with NutriFusion diets for 2 months prior to the rmTBI and until euthanasia (6 months). Mice were then subsequently euthanized for macro- and micro-histopathologic analysis for various times up to 6 months after the last TBI received. Animals were examined behaviorally, and brain sections were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes, iba-1 for activated microglia, and AT8 for phosphorylated tau protein. Animals on nutrient diets showed attenuated behavioral changes. The brains from all mice lacked macroscopic tissue damage at all time points. The rmTBI resulted in a marked neuroinflammatory response, with persistent and widespread astrogliosis and microglial activation, as well as significantly elevated phospho-tau immunoreactivity to 6 months. Mice treated with diets had significantly reduced inflammation and phospho-tau staining. The neuropathological findings in the rmTBI mice showed histopathological hallmarks of CTE, including increased astrogliosis, microglial activation, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein accumulation, while mice treated with diets had attenuated disease process. These studies demonstrate that consumption of nutrient-rich diets reduced disease progression. "
2018-09-01,"The annual incidence of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) is 3.8 million in the USA with 10⁻15% experiencing persistent morbidity beyond one year. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease characterized by accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau, can occur with repetitive MTBI. Risk factors for CTE are challenging to identify because injury mechanisms of MTBI are heterogeneous, clinical manifestations and management vary, and CTE is a postmortem diagnosis, making prospective studies difficult. There is growing interest in the genetic influence on head trauma and development of CTE. Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 ( "
2018-09-01,"Readmissions after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) have significant impact on long-term patient outcomes through interruption of rehabilitation. This study examined readmissions in a rural population, hypothesizing that readmitted patients after TBI will be older and have more comorbidities than those not readmitted. Discharge data on all patients 15 years and older who were admitted to an Arkansas-based hospital for TBI were obtained from the Arkansas Hospital Discharge Data System from 2010 to 2014. This data set includes diagnoses (principal discharge diagnosis, up to 3 external cause of injury codes, 18 diagnosis codes using the International Classification of Disease, 9th Edition, Clinical Modifications), age, gender, and inpatient costs. Hospital Cost and Utilization Project Clinical Classification and Chronic Condition Indicator were used to identify chronic disease and body systems affected in principal diagnosis. Of the 3114 cases of significant head trauma, more than two-thirds were attributed to fall injuries, with motor vehicle crashes accounting for 20% of the remainder. The mean length of stay was 6.5 days. 691 of these patients were admitted to an Arkansas hospital in the following year, totaling 1368 readmissions. Of the readmissions, 16.4% of patients were admitted for altered mental status, 12.9% with shortness of breath (SOB), and 9.4% with chest pain. Mental disorders (psychosis, dementia, and depression) and organic nervous symptoms (Alzheimer's disease, encephalopathy, and epilepsy) were the primary source of readmissions. More than one-third of the patients were admitted in the following year for chronic diseases such as heart failure (8.6%), psychosis (5.2%), and cerebral artery occlusion (4.1%). This study showed that there is a significant rate of readmissions in the year after a diagnosis of TBI. Complications with existing chronic diseases are among the most reported reasons for admission in this time period, demonstrating the effect severe head trauma has on long-term treatment.

2018-09-01,"Given the concerns regarding chronic traumatic encephalopathy and its potential association with violent behavior in football players, we investigated the rates of deaths and arrests related to homicide among the National Football League (NFL) population. In order to accomplish this, we performed a retrospective analysis of the 27 155 individuals who had played, or are currently playing, professional football since its inception in 1920. The number of observed homicides in this cohort was compared to the number of expected homicides using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention annual tables. Information regarding player cause of death was obtained from web-based sources. We identified 17 (0.27%) homicides among the 6356 NFL player deaths. The average age of individuals dying as the result of homicide was 31.4 years (range 24-50 years). Gunshot wound was the leading cause of death. The standardized mortality ratio for death by homicide was historically below 5%. As compared to the general US population, there were about 70% fewer deaths by homicide in the NFL population than would be expected. Our study also found only 0.04% of the NFL player population has ever been the focus of a homicide investigation, with only 0.02% of the NFL player population having been convicted. Our findings suggest homicidal violence among NFL players is rare, as NFL players have substantially lower rates of dying and being arrested as a consequence of homicidal violence compared to the general US population.

We examined CSF concentrations of total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau, and amyloid β Sixty-eight former NFL players and 21 controls underwent lumbar puncture to quantify t-tau, p-tau No between-group differences for CSF analytes emerged. In the former NFL players, the cumulative head impact index predicted higher t-tau concentrations (P = .041), and higher sTREM2 levels were associated with higher t-tau concentrations (P = .009). In this sample of former NFL players, greater RHI and increased microglial activation were associated with higher CSF t-tau concentrations. "
2018-09-01,"Traumatic brain injury is a risk factor for subsequent neurodegenerative disease, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a tauopathy mostly associated with repetitive concussion and blast, but not well recognized as a consequence of severe traumatic brain injury. Here we show that a single severe brain trauma is associated with the emergence of widespread hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in a proportion of humans surviving late after injury. In parallel experimental studies, in a model of severe traumatic brain injury in wild-type mice, we found progressive and widespread tau pathology, replicating the findings in humans. Brain homogenates from these mice, when inoculated into the hippocampus and overlying cerebral cortex of naïve mice, induced widespread tau pathology, synaptic loss, and persistent memory deficits. These data provide evidence that experimental brain trauma induces a self-propagating tau pathology, which can be transmitted between mice, and call for future studies aimed at investigating the potential transmissibility of trauma associated tau pathology in humans.

2019-10-01,"To provide an overview of 3 studies of the same population of retired professional contact sport athletes compared with age-matched noncontact sport athlete controls on cognition, executive function, behavior, and advanced brain imaging. University Concussion Management Clinic. Twenty-two retired professional hockey and football athletes (average age 56 years) and 21 age-matched noncontact sport athlete controls. Case control. Participants were assessed on a broad range of neuropsychological measures that are associated with identification of mild cognitive impairment and executive function. Athletes were also assessed using self-report measures of executive function and personality. Advanced structural and functional imaging techniques were utilized as well. The former National Football League and National Hockey League athletes perceived themselves to have impaired executive function, but this was not confirmed by objective neurocognitive assessment. No significant differences were found when comparing contact-sport athletes with controls on the presence of mild cognitive impairment or brain structural and functional tissue injury. Contact sport athletes were more anxious and more likely to report unusual beliefs and experiences. None of the retired contact sport athletes qualified as having early-onset dementia consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. There were no remarkable differences in imaging, cognition, behavior, or executive function from noncontact sport athletes. The results underscore an apparent disconnect between public perceptions and evidence-based conclusions about the inevitability of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the potential neurodegenerative effect on former athletes from contact sports.

2018-09-01,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are physiological vesicles secreted from most eukaryotes and contain cargos of their cell of origin. EVs, and particularly a subset of EV known as exosomes, are emerging as key mediators of cell to cell communication and waste management for cells both during normal organismal function and in disease. In this review, we investigate the rapidly growing field of exosome biology, their biogenesis, cargo loading, and uptake by other cells. We particularly consider the role of exosomes in Alzheimer's disease, both as a pathogenic agent and as a disease biomarker. We also explore the emerging role of exosomes in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, we highlight open questions in these fields and the possible use of exosomes as therapeutic targets and agents. "
2018-09-01,"Traumatic brain injury has been associated with increased risk of Parkinson disease and parkinsonism, and parkinsonism and Lewy body disease (LBD) can occur with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). To test whether contact sports and CTE are associated with LBD, we compared deceased contact sports athletes (n = 269) to cohorts from the community (n = 164) and the Boston University Alzheimer disease (AD) Center (n = 261). Participants with CTE and LBD were more likely to have β-amyloid deposition, dementia, and parkinsonism than CTE alone (p < 0.05). Traditional and hierarchical clustering showed a similar pattern of LBD distribution in CTE compared to LBD alone that was most frequently neocortical, limbic, or brainstem. In the community-based cohort, years of contact sports play were associated with neocortical LBD (OR = 1.30 per year, p = 0.012), and in a pooled analysis a threshold of >8 years of play best predicted neocortical LBD (ROC analysis, OR = 6.24, 95% CI = 1.5-25, p = 0.011), adjusting for age, sex, and APOE ɛ4 allele status. Clinically, dementia was significantly associated with neocortical LBD, CTE stage, and AD; parkinsonism was associated with LBD pathology but not CTE stage. Contact sports participation may increase risk of developing neocortical LBD, and increased LBD frequency may partially explain extrapyramidal motor symptoms sometimes observed in CTE. "
2018-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is associated with pathological changes, yet detecting these changes during life has proven elusive. Positron emission tomography (PET) offers the potential for identifying such pathology. Few studies have been completed to date and their approaches and results have been diverse. It was the objective of this review to systematically examine relevant research using ligands for PET that bind to identified pathology in CTE. We focused on identification of patterns of binding and addressing gaps in knowledge of PET imaging for CTE. A comprehensive literature search was conducted. Data used were published on or before May 22, 2017. As the extant literature is limited, any peer-reviewed article assessing military, contact sports athletes, or professional fighters was considered for inclusion. The main outcomes were regional binding to brain regions identified through control comparisons or through clinical metrics (e.g., standardized uptake volume ratios). A total of 1207 papers were identified for review, of which six met inclusion criteria. Meta-analyses were planned but were deemed inappropriate given the small number of studies identified. Methodological concerns in these initial papers included small sample sizes, lack of a control comparison, use of nonstandard statistical procedures to quantify data, and interpretation of potentially off-target binding areas. Across studies, the hippocampi, amygdalae, and midbrain had reasonably consistent increased uptake. Evidence for increased uptake in cortical regions was less consistent. The evidence suggests that the field of PET imaging in those at risk for CTE remains nascent. As the field evolves to include more stringent studies, ligands for PET may prove an important tool in identifying CTE in vivo. "
2018-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) occupies a unique and expanding position in both the scientific and lay communities concerned with sport participation at all levels. The benefits of rapid, widespread reporting and increased public awareness are counterbalanced by misinformation and an oversimplification of an increasingly complex topic. In this Viewpoint, we will describe the current understanding of CTE pathology and proposed criteria for characterizing traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES), the proposed clinical syndrome associated with underlying CTE pathology, but possibly other proteinopathies as well. We want to emphasize that CTE and TES are not the same entity, at least according to our current understanding. We additionally highlight those at greatest risk for CTE and the significant challenges to symptom attribution specific to these populations.

2018-08-01,"Neurodegenerative disorders constitute a group of multifaceted conditions characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and synaptic connections consequent to a combination of specific genetic predispositions and stochastic stressors. The neuropathologies observed in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are in part attributed to compounding intrinsic and extrinsic environmental stressors, which we propose may be limited by the administration of specific grape derived phytochemicals and their metabolized derivatives, specifically polyphenols isolated from grape botanicals. Current therapies for neurodegenerative disorders are limited as they solely target the final disease pathologies including behavioral changes, cognitive deficits, proteinopathies and neuronal loss; however, this strategy is not a sustainable approach toward managing disease onset or progression. This review discusses the application of grape derived polyphenols as an adjunctive treatment paradigm for the prevention of neuropathologies associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy by simultaneously ameliorating two stochastic stressors that facilitate their disease pathologies: inflammation and oxidative stress. The biophysical attributes of grape-derived polyphenols buffer against redox potential dependent peripheral and neuroinflammation and down regulate the activation of inflammasomes in microglia and astrocytes, which could provide a novel mechanism through which grape-derived polyphenols simultaneously suppress risk factors across pathologically distinct neurodegenerative conditions. This approach therefore offers a prophylactic mode, not feasible through current pharmacological agents, to target activity dependent risk factors for neurodegenerative disorders that manifest over an individual's lifetime.

However, no study has characterized changes in TDP-43 phosphorylation, mislocalization, and fragmentation (i.e., abnormalities linked to hallmark TDP-43 pathology) after TBI, and how these relate to functional outcomes. Further, how TBI affects an individual with a known predisposition to TDP-43 pathology is unknown. Therefore, this study examined the effects of TBI on TDP-43 post-translational processing, localization, and behavioral outcomes in wild-type (WT) mice and mutant TDP-43 "
2018-08-01,"Dystonia is often associated with damage to basal ganglia (BG), but neuropathological assessments of these cases are infrequent. A brain was assessed with possible post-traumatic focal dystonia that appeared after an accident occurred during childhood. Tau pathology was found within putamen and globus pallidus of the right hemisphere, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was observed in the cortex of the left hemisphere. No diffuse axonal injury (DAI),  Post-traumatic dystonia could be associated with post-traumatic tau pathology formation. However, more cases are necessary to establish causality. The tau lesions found in the BG of this patient did not fit within CTE criteria. We hypothesize that due to the anatomo-histological characteristics of the BG, tau pathology associated with brain traumas produce histopathological patterns different from sulcal-tau pathology, which is the only tau pathology distribution currently accepted as pathognomonic of CTE.

2018-08-01,"There was a long-lasting debate during the first half of the 1900s about whether boxers suffered from a condition called ""dementia pugilistica"". This included arguments as to whether there was such a distinct clinical condition, whether it was static or progressive, and whether boxers were actually at any increased risk of any neurological issues at all. The debate was never resolved, but was resuscitated in 2005 with the speculation that a similar condition, dubbed ""chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)"" existed in retired National Football League (NFL) players. A specific pattern of p-tau deposition has been identified in the brains of NFL retirees, and also identifiable in the brains of at least a percentage of individuals exposed to contact sports in general. Advocates of CTE as a disease describe it as presenting with behavioral disturbance, increased suicidality and neurodegeneration leading to dementia. The evidence to date, however, does not rise to the level of a verifiable disease, and remains at the level of case report. To assume that CTE pathology represents a neurodegenerative disease flies in the face of a number of facts, including that traumatic brain injury does not cause neurodegeneration, protein deposits in the brain are a poor predictor of behavioral symptoms, p-tau is not necessarily toxic or self-propagating, and retired NFL players are actually much physically and mentally healthier than men of their demographic background. They have an all-cause mortality rate that is 50% of that expected, and a suicide rate that is 40% of that expected. The most parsimonious explanation of the evidence to date is that repetitive head trauma may result in p-tau deposition, but that this isoform of p-tau is inert and has no toxic or self-propagating effects.

2018-08-01,"Suicide ranks among the leading causes of death for individuals of all ages with highest rates in the elderly. The cause of suicide is considered a multifactorial phenomenon. A variety of neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease, or, more recently, tauopathies as frontotemporal lobar degeneration or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, has been suggested as risk factor for suicide. Accordingly, we hypothesized that neurodegenerative changes typical of these diseases should be more prevalent in the brains of suicides when compared with controls. Suicides from the German federal state of Hamburg (n = 162) were compared with age- and sex-matched controls who died of other cause. Neuropathological assessment included semiquantitative analysis of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles visualized with silver stains; in addition, quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of β-amyloid load and counts of tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads was done. Univariate analysis and multivariable conditional logistic regression models did not show an effect of any parameter associated with the odds of committing suicide. On the contrary, after stratification for age, older suicide victims (over 48 years) showed lower β-amyloid loads when compared to controls in the univariate analysis (suicides: 4.7 ± 12.9; controls: 9.9 ± 20.9; p = 0.031; r = - 0.17). In conclusion, neuropathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease and common tauopathies associated with age seem to be of limited relevance for suicides. However, intact cognition when planning and carrying out complex acts may be of importance in the context of suicide. "
2018-07-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been receiving increasing attention due to press coverage of professional football players. The devastating sequelae of CTE compel us to aim for early diagnosis and treatment. However, by current standards, CTE is challenging to diagnose. Clear clinical diagnostic criteria for CTE have not been established. Only recently, pathological diagnostic criteria have been recognized, but postmortem diagnosis is too late. Reliable biomarkers are not available. By imaging criteria, cavum septum pellucidum has been the only consistent identifiable MRI finding. Because of the imprecise nature of diagnosis based on clinical suspicion, physicians must become cognizant of the broad spectrum of presentations of CTE. With this awareness, appropriate workup can be initiated. CTE can present with early symptoms of emotional changes or late symptoms with memory decline and dementia. Here we present an unusual case of a patient with Alzheimer's disease secondary to suspected CTE that stems from subconcussive head impacts presenting with severe memory and MRI changes. Clinicians should be aware of this presentation and consider CTE in their differential diagnoses while undergoing workup of memory disorders. "
2018-07-01,"Despite the risks, concussion symptoms often go underreported by athletes, leading to delayed or forgone treatment and increased potential for concussion recurrence. One of the most serious long-term consequences of sports-related concussions is Chronic Traumatic Encephelopathy (CTE), a disorder associated with progressive neurological deterioration. The purpose of this study was to explore former collegiate athletes' understanding of concussions and motivations behind concussion non-disclosure in order to better assist family medicine providers in screening for and managing a history of concussions. Informed by the theoretical framework Social Cognitive Theory, we conducted focus groups with former collegiate athletes using a field-tested discussion guide. Discussions were transcribed, coded, and analyzed via content and thematic analyses using NVivo 10 software. Thirty-two former collegiate athletes (24.5 ± 2.9 years old, 59.4% female, 87.5% white) participated in 7 focus groups. Three predominant themes emerged: 1) Concussions are Part of the Game: Participants believed that concussions were part of sports, and that by agreeing to play a sport they were accepting the inherent risk of concussions. Importantly, many were not familiar with concussion symptoms and what constituted a concussion; 2) Hiding Concussion Symptoms: Participants said they often hid concussion symptoms from coaches and trainers in order to avoid being taken out of or missing games. Participants were able to hide their concussions because most symptoms were indiscernible to others; and 3) Misconceptions about Concussions in Low Contact Sports: Several participants did not understand that concussions could occur in all sports including low contact or noncontact sports. The former athletes who participated in low contact sports and experienced concussions attributed their concussions to personal clumsiness rather than their sport. Family medicine providers as well as coaches, athletic trainers, teachers, and parents/guardians should reinforce the message that concussions can occur in all sports and inform patients about the signs and symptoms of concussions. Further, providers should ask all patients if they engaged in high school or collegiate athletics; and if yes, to describe their hardest hit to their head in order to obtain a complete medical history.

2018-07-01,"Epidemiological studies suggest that a single moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Histopathological studies describe complex neurodegenerative pathologies in individuals exposed to single moderate-to-severe TBI or repetitive mild TBI, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, the clinicopathological links between TBI and post-traumatic neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD, and CTE remain poorly understood. Here, we describe the methodology of the Late Effects of TBI (LETBI) study, whose goals are to characterize chronic post-traumatic neuropathology and to identify in vivo biomarkers of post-traumatic neurodegeneration. LETBI participants undergo extensive clinical evaluation using National Institutes of Health TBI Common Data Elements, proteomic and genomic analysis, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and prospective consent for brain donation. Selected brain specimens undergo ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI and histopathological evaluation including whole-mount analysis. Co-registration of ex vivo and in vivo MRI data enables identification of ex vivo lesions that were present during life. In vivo signatures of postmortem pathology are then correlated with cognitive and behavioral data to characterize the clinical phenotype(s) associated with pathological brain lesions. We illustrate the study methods and demonstrate proof of concept for this approach by reporting results from the first LETBI participant, who despite the presence of multiple in vivo and ex vivo pathoanatomic lesions had normal cognition and was functionally independent until her mid-80s. The LETBI project represents a multidisciplinary effort to characterize post-traumatic neuropathology and identify in vivo signatures of postmortem pathology in a prospective study. "
2018-07-01,"The current classification of traumatic brain injury (TBI) into ""mild"", ""moderate"", or ""severe"" does not adequately account for the patient heterogeneity that still exists within each of these categories. The objective of this study was to identify ""sub-groups"" of mild TBI (mTBI) patients based on data available at the time of the initial post-TBI patient evaluation and to determine if the sub-grouping correlates with patient outcomes at 90 and 180 days post-TBI. Data from patients in the TRACK-TBI Pilot dataset who had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15 at arrival to the Emergency Department and a closed head injury were included. Considering 53 clinical variables that are typically available during the initial evaluation of the patient with mild TBI, sparse heirarchial clustering with cluster quality assessment was used to identify the optimal number of patient sub-groups. Patient sub-groups were then compared for ten outcomes measured at 90 or 180 days post-TBI. Amongst the 485 patients with mTBI, optimal clustering was based on the inclusion of 12 clinical variables that divided the patients into 5 mild TBI sub-groups. Clinical variables driving the sub-clustering included: gender, employment status, marital status, TBI due to falling, brain CT scan result, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, administration of IV fluids in the Emergency Department, alcohol use, tobacco use, history of neurologic disease, and history of psychiatric disease. These 5 mild TBI sub-groups differed in their 90 day and 180 day outcomes within several domains including global outcomes, persistence of TBI-related symptoms, and neuropsychological impairment. Sub-groups of patients with mTBI can be identified according to clinical variables that are relatively easy to obtain at the time of initial patient evaluation. A patient's sub-group assignment is associated with multidimensional patient outcomes at 90 and 180 days. These findings support the notion that there are clinically meaningful subgroups of patients amongst those currently classified as having mTBI. "
2018-07-01,"Regular engagement in sports produces many health benefits, but also exposes to increased injury risk. The quality of medical care available is crucial not only for sports trauma but also to avoid overuse syndromes and post-traumatic degenerative conditions. We provide background information on some clinical needs in sport injuries and describe the main families of biological products used in clinical practice. We also discuss limitations of the current clinical experience. Sport and exercise impairment affects different segments of the population with different needs. The exceptional demands of elite athletes and subsequent media coverage have created hype around regenerative therapies. Statistical evidence, whether weak (cell products) or moderate (PRPs), is not enough to drive medical decisions because of the heterogeneity of the biological products available and their application procedures. Moreover, the specific needs of the different segments of the population along with the available clinical evidence for each musculoskeletal condition should be considered in the decision-making process. There is urgent need to develop regenerative protocols combined with post-intervention rehabilitation, and gather meaningful clinical data on the safety and efficacy of these interventions in the different populations segments.

2018-07-01,"OBJECTIVE Increased understanding of the consequences of traumatic brain injury has heightened concerns about youth participation in contact sports. This study investigated the prevalence of high school and collegiate contact sports play and concussion history among surgical department chairs. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was administered to 107 orthopedic and 74 neurosurgery chairs. Responses were compared to published historical population norms for contact sports (high school 27.74%, collegiate 1.44%), football (high school 10.91%, collegiate 0.76%), and concussion prevalence (12%). One-proportion Z-tests, chi-square tests, and binary logistic regression were used to analyze differences. RESULTS High school contact sports participation was 2.35-fold higher (65.3%, p < 0.001) for orthopedic chairs and 1.73-fold higher (47.9%, p = 0.0018) for neurosurgery chairs than for their high school peers. Collegiate contact sports play was 31.0-fold higher (44.7%, p < 0.001) for orthopedic chairs and 15.1-fold higher (21.7%, p < 0.001) for neurosurgery chairs than for their college peers. Orthopedic chairs had a 4.30-fold higher rate of high school football participation (46.9%, p < 0.001) while neurosurgery chairs reported a 3.05-fold higher rate (33.3%, p < 0.001) than their high school peers. Orthopedic chairs reported a 28.1-fold higher rate of collegiate football participation (21.3%, p < 0.001) and neurosurgery chairs reported an 8.58-fold higher rate (6.5%, p < 0.001) compared to their college peers. The rate at which orthopedic (42.6%, p < 0.001) and neurosurgical (42.4%, p < 0.001) chairs reported having at least 1 concussion in their lifetime was significantly higher than the reported prevalence in the general population. After correction for worst possible ascertainment bias, all results except high school contact sports participation remained significant. CONCLUSIONS The high prevalence of youth contact sports play and concussion among surgical specialty chairs affirms that individuals in careers requiring high motor and cognitive function frequently played contact sports. The association highlights the need to further examine the relationships between contact sports and potential long-term benefits as well as risks of sport-related injury. "
2018-06-01,"Repetitive head trauma provides a favorable milieu for the onset of inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. The result of long-lasting head trauma is chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a disease process well-recognized in boxers, military personnel, and more recently, in American football players. CTE is a chronic neurodegenerative disease with hallmarks of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) aggregates and intercellular lesions of neurofibrillary tangles. The criteria for CTE diagnosis requires at least 1-2 focal perivascular lesions of p-tau in the cerebral cortex, at the depth of the sulci. These pathognomonic lesions aggregate within neurons and glial cells such as astrocytes, and cell processes within the vicinity of small blood vessels. CTE presents in a distinct topographical distribution pattern compared to other tauopathies such as AD and other age-related astrogliopathies. CTE also has an insidious onset, years after repetitive head trauma. The disease course of CTE is characterized by cognitive dysfunction, behavioral changes, and can progress to altered motor function with parkinsonian-like manifestations in later stages. This short review aims to summarize CTE in professional football, epidemiology, diagnosis based on neuroanatomical abnormalities, cognitive degeneration, and adverse mental health effects, as well as gaps in the literature and future directions in diagnostics, therapeutics, and preventive measures.

2018-06-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Increasing evidence indicates that TBI is an important risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Despite improved supportive and rehabilitative care of TBI patients, unfortunately, all late phase clinical trials in TBI have yet to yield a safe and effective neuroprotective treatment. The disappointing clinical trials may be attributed to variability in treatment approaches and heterogeneity of the population of TBI patients as well as a race against time to prevent or reduce inexorable cell death. TBI is not just an acute event but a chronic disease. Among many mechanisms involved in secondary injury after TBI, emerging preclinical studies indicate that posttraumatic prolonged and progressive neuroinflammation is associated with neurodegeneration which may be treatable long after the initiating brain injury. This review provides an overview of recent understanding of neuroinflammation in TBI and preclinical cell-based therapies that target neuroinflammation and promote functional recovery after TBI. "
2018-06-01,"To review the intellectual history of concussion from the mid-19th century to the opening decade of the 21st century. Head injuries (HI) and their acute and long-term effects have been investigated for centuries, with major reviews of the topic appearing by 1870. Thus, while it has long been acknowledged that chronic traumatic encephalopathy was first described by Harrison Martland in 1928, an examination of the history of concussion research up to Martland's seminal report places his studies in a deeper historical context. This history makes clear that Martland's findings were one among many such studies showcasing the lasting dangers of blows to the head. In the years after Martland published his study, his paper was frequently cited in other papers that made clear that blows to the head, of all ranges of severity, were dangerous injuries with potentially life-changing consequences. The author has engaged in an historical analysis of the development and elaboration of concussion research in clinical medicine, neurology, neurosurgery, and those scientific disciplines related to clinical medicine. The author has found numerous primary sources from the history of medicine and science that describe the acute and chronic effects of single and repeated sub-concussive and concussive blows to the head. This study makes clear that evidence-based methodologies inevitably short-change the knowledge of past clinicians and scientists by holding these figures to normative standards of recent invention. What criticism of this kind fails to recognize is that past investigators, many of them pioneers in their fields, published their work in ways that matched the highest normative standards of their day for the presentation of evidence. It has been recognized for a long time that concussions are dangerous injuries with potentially life-changing consequences, ranging from permanent symptoms to degenerative neurological states. The intellectual history of medicine and science from 1870 to the recent past shows both a continuity of clinical observations about HI and a steady, incremental accumulation of knowledge refining our understanding of those observations from a remarkably wide sphere of scientific disciplines.

2018-06-01,"Military personnel and athletes exposed to traumatic brain injury may develop chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Brain pathology in CTE includes intracellular accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau proteins (p-tau), the main constituent of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Recently, we found that cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) neurons within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), which provide the major cholinergic innervation to the cortex, display an increased number of NFTs across the pathological stages of CTE. However, molecular mechanisms underlying nbM neurodegeneration in the context of CTE pathology remain unknown. Here, we assessed the genetic signature of nbM neurons containing the p-tau pretangle maker pS422 from CTE subjects who came to autopsy and received a neuropathological CTE staging assessment (Stages II, III, and IV) using laser capture microdissection and custom-designed microarray analysis. Quantitative analysis revealed dysregulation of key genes in several gene ontology groups between CTE stages. Specifically, downregulation of the nicotinic cholinergic receptor subunit β-2 gene (CHRNB2), monoaminergic enzymes catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopa decarboxylase (DDC), chloride channels CLCN4 and CLCN5, scaffolding protein caveolin 1 (CAV1), cortical development/cytoskeleton element lissencephaly 1 (LIS1), and intracellular signaling cascade member adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3) was observed in pS422-immunreactive nbM neurons in CTE patients. By contrast, upregulation of calpain 2 (CAPN2) and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) transcript levels was found in Stage IV CTE patients. These single-population data in vulnerable neurons indicate alterations in gene expression associated with neurotransmission, signal transduction, the cytoskeleton, cell survival/death signaling, and microtubule dynamics, suggesting novel molecular pathways to target for drug discovery in CTE.

2018-05-01,"OBJECTIVERepetitive subconcussive head trauma is a consequence of participation in contact sports and may be linked to neurodegenerative diseases. The degree of neurological injury caused by subconcussive head trauma is not easily detectible, and this injury does not induce readily identifiable clinical signs or symptoms. Recent advancements in immunoassays make possible the detection and quantification of blood biomarkers linked to head trauma. Identification of a blood biomarker that can identify the extent of neurological injury associated with subconcussive head trauma may provide an objective measure for informed decisions concerning cumulative exposure to subconcussive head trauma. The purpose of the current study was to examine changes in the blood biomarkers of subconcussive head trauma over the course of an American football season.METHODSThirty-five National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) American football athletes underwent blood sampling throughout the course of a football season. Serial samples were obtained throughout the 2016 season, during which the number and magnitude of head impacts changed. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma concentrations of tau and serum concentrations of neurofilament light polypeptide (NF-L). Athletes were grouped based on their starter status, because athletes identified as starters are known to sustain a greater number of impacts. Between-group differences and time-course differences were assessed.RESULTSIn nonstarters, plasma concentrations of tau decreased over the course of the season, with lower values observed in starters; this resulted in a lower area under the curve (AUC) (starters: 416.78 ± 129.17 pg/ml/day; nonstarters: 520.84 ± 163.19 pg/ml/day; p = 0.050). Plasma concentrations of tau could not be used to discern between starters and nonstarters. In contrast, serum concentrations of NF-L increased throughout the season as head impacts accumulated, specifically in those athletes categorized as starters. The higher serum concentrations of NF-L observed in starters resulted in a larger AUC (starters: 1605.03 ± 655.09 pg/ml/day; nonstarters: 1067.29 ± 272.33 pg/ml/day; p = 0.007). The AUC of the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses displayed fair to modest accuracy to identify athletes who were starters with the use of serum NF-L following periods of repetitive impacts.CONCLUSIONSThe different patterns observed in serum NF-L and plasma tau concentrations provide preliminary evidence for the use of blood biomarkers to detect the neurological injury associated with repetitive subconcussive head trauma. Although further investigation is necessary, such findings might lay the foundation for the further development of an objective measure for the detection of neurological injury caused by subconcussive head trauma.

2018-05-01,"Multiple concussions, particularly in contact sports, have been associated with cognitive deficits, psychiatric impairment and neurodegenerative diseases like chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We used volumetric and deformation-based morphometric analyses to test the hypothesis that repeated concussions may be associated with smaller regional brain volumes, poorer cognitive performance and behavioural symptoms among former professional football players compared to healthy controls. This study included fifty-three retired Canadian Football League players, 25 age- and education-matched healthy controls, and controls from the Cambridge Centre for Aging and Neuroscience database for validation. Volumetric analyses revealed greater hippocampal atrophy than expected for age in former athletes with multiple concussions than controls and smaller left hippocampal volume was associated with poorer verbal memory performance in the former athletes. Deformation-based morphometry confirmed smaller bilateral hippocampal volume that was associated with poorer verbal memory performance in athletes. Repeated concussions may lead to greater regional atrophy than expected for age. "

2018-05-01,"To examine the effect of age of first exposure to tackle football on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) pathological severity and age of neurobehavioral symptom onset in tackle football players with neuropathologically confirmed CTE. The sample included 246 tackle football players who donated their brains for neuropathological examination. Two hundred eleven were diagnosed with CTE (126 of 211 were without comorbid neurodegenerative diseases), and 35 were without CTE. Informant interviews ascertained age of first exposure and age of cognitive and behavioral/mood symptom onset. Analyses accounted for decade and duration of play. Age of exposure was not associated with CTE pathological severity, or Alzheimer's disease or Lewy body pathology. In the 211 participants with CTE, every 1 year younger participants began to play tackle football predicted earlier reported cognitive symptom onset by 2.44 years (p < 0.0001) and behavioral/mood symptoms by 2.50 years (p < 0.0001). Age of exposure before 12 predicted earlier cognitive (p < 0.0001) and behavioral/mood (p < 0.0001) symptom onset by 13.39 and 13.28 years, respectively. In participants with dementia, younger age of exposure corresponded to earlier functional impairment onset. Similar effects were observed in the 126 CTE-only participants. Effect sizes were comparable in participants without CTE. In this sample of deceased tackle football players, younger age of exposure to tackle football was not associated with CTE pathological severity, but predicted earlier neurobehavioral symptom onset. Youth exposure to tackle football may reduce resiliency to late-life neuropathology. These findings may not generalize to the broader tackle football population, and informant-report may have affected the accuracy of the estimated effects. Ann Neurol 2018;83:886-901. "
2018-05-01,"Learning about concussion diagnosis and management is important for all individuals who will be taking care of young athletes. There are about 1.7million reported concussions per year, and, of these, about 20% are sports related. There are risks in all sports, but the highest rates of concussions are from football, rugby, and hockey, with soccer being the highest cause for girls. An on-field assessment includes evaluating airway, breathing, and circulation, followed by cervical spine assessment. Then, concussion evaluation tools can be used to aid in making the diagnosis. While concussion symptoms for the majority of youth resolve within a few weeks, some individuals may have persistence of symptoms for 3 months or more, referred to as postconcussive syndrome. Providers should consider ongoing symptoms in assessing when an athlete may safely return to sports and to learning. A major concern that has become more apparent in recent years is the possibility that concussions may have a longitudinal effect on health, such as in the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Research has shown that there is an increase in the number of patients presenting to their primary care physician with concussions. Knowing how best to prevent, diagnose, and manage concussions will help to minimize risks to young athletes. "
2018-05-01,"Neonatal traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of developmental disorders. Autologous stem cell therapy may enhance neonatal brain plasticity towards repair of the injured neonatal brain. The endogenous neonatal anti-inflammatory response can be enhanced through the delivery of anti-inflammatory agents. Stem cell therapy stands as a robust approach for sequestering the inflammation-induced cell death in the injured brain. Here, we discuss the use of umbilical cord blood cells and bone marrow stromal cells for acute and chronic treatment of experimental neonatal TBI. Autologous stem cell transplantation may dampen neuroinflammation. Clinical translation of this stem cell therapy will require identifying the therapeutic window post-injury and harvesting ample supply of transplantable autologous stem cells. Stem cell banking of cryopreserved cells may allow readily available transplantable cells and circumvent the unpredictable nature of neonatal TBI. Harnessing the anti-inflammatory properties of stem cells is key in combating the progressive neurodegeneration after the initial injury. Combination treatments, such as with hypothermia, may enhance the therapeutic effects of stem cells. Stem cell therapy has immense potential as a stand-alone or adjunctive therapy for treating neuroinflammation associated with neonatal TBI acutely and for preventing further progression of the injury. "
2018-05-01,"Concussion in athletes can contribute to early neuropsychological changes that may be indicative of future neurodegenerative disease. One of the hallmark findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy is anxiety and impulsive behavior that often develops early in the course of the disease. The behavioral dysfunction can be grouped into a broader category referred to as cognitive disruption. The current gold standard for diagnosing chronic neurodegeneration is post-mortem evaluation of tauopathy to identify neurofibrillary tau tangles in neurons. Few studies, however, have looked at clinical correlations between acute injury and chronic neurodegeneration in terms of behavior. This lack of focus towards translational study has limited advancements towards treatment. In this pilot investigation, the acute cognitive and emotional (anger, impulsivity, and anxiety) affects of concussion in a cohort of collegiate athletes (n = 30) are examined and compared to findings in the post-mortem pathologic features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Specifically, the role of the seroternergic system with alpha synuclein and tauopathy staining and the potential for early clinically relevant behavioral and pharmaceutical interventions was investigated. The purpose was to determine if athletes began demonstrating cognitive disruption present in post-mortem evaluation during the acute phase of injury. The acute data was collected via questionnaires within ten days of the athletes' concussion diagnosis. Results demonstrated that 11 of 30 athletes (36%) scored in a diagnosable range of anxiety post-concussion, and athletes scored above the norm in state-anger ( "

While the neuropathology underlying these disorders is most consistent with a widespread alteration in the metabolism of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), in both ALS with cognitive impairment (ALSci) and ALS with FTD (ALS-FTD; also known as MND-FTD) there is evidence for alterations in the metabolism of the microtubule associated protein tau.

2018-04-01,"The objective of this study was to assess the incidence of motor impairment in former professional Canadian Football League (ex-CFL) players with multiple concussions. We investigated motor symptoms and signs in 45 ex-CFL players with multiple concussions and 25 age- and education-matched healthy controls with no history of concussion. Neurological assessment included items from the SCAT3 (Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 3) and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-Part III). A performance-based measurement of manual motor function was undertaken using the Grooved Pegboard test. Cognition was measured with patient-reported outcomes for memory, executive and behavioral symptoms as well as performance-based measures of memory and executive function. Symptoms of anxiety and depression were measured using the Personality Assessment Inventory. There was no significant difference between the ex-CFL players and controls on the UPDRS-Part III scores, and neither group reported clinically significant motor complaints. Ex-CFL players did not perform differently from control subjects on the Grooved Pegboard test. In contrast, with regard to cognitive and mood testing, players were more symptomatic: The ex-CFL players reported significantly more memory (77.8% vs. 16%, respectively, p < 0.001), executive (53.3% vs. 8%, respectively, p < 0.001), and behavioral symptoms (66.7% vs. 20%, respectively, p < 0.001). No significant differences were found when comparing ex-CFL players and controls in performance on memory and executive tests. In summary, in a group of retired CFL players who self-reported declines in memory, executive and behavioral symptoms, no motor symptoms were reported and no motor signs were detected. "
2018-04-01,"OBJECTIVEMild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in athletes, including concussion, is increasingly being found to have long-term sequelae. Current imaging techniques have not been able to identify early damage caused by mTBI that is predictive of long-term symptoms or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In this preliminary feasibility study, the authors investigated the use of an emerging magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, multicomponent driven equilibrium single pulse observation of T1 and T2 (mcDESPOT), in visualizing acute and chronic white matter changes after mTBI in collegiate football and rugby players.METHODSThis study was a nonrandomized, nonblinded prospective trial designed to quantify changes in the myelin water fraction (MWF), used as a surrogate MRI measure of myelin content, in a group of male collegiate football and rugby players, classified here as a contact sport player (CSP) cohort, at the time of mTBI diagnosis and 3 months after injury when the acute symptoms of the injury had resolved. In addition, differences in the MWF between the CSP cohort and a control cohort of noncontact sport players (NCSPs) were quantified. T-tests and a threshold-free cluster enhancement (TFCE) statistical analysis technique were used to identify brain structures with significant changes in the MWF between the CSP and NCSP cohorts and between immediately postinjury and follow-up images obtained in the CSP cohort.RESULTSBrain MR images of 12 right-handed male CSPs were analyzed and compared with brain images of 10 right-handed male NCSPs from the same institution. A comparison of CSP and NCSP baseline images using TFCE showed significantly higher MWFs in the bilateral basal ganglia, anterior and posterior corpora callosa, left corticospinal tract, and left anterior and superior temporal lobe (p < 0.05). At the 3-month follow-up examination, images from the CSP cohort still showed significantly higher MWFs than those identified on baseline images from the NCSP cohort in the bilateral basal ganglia, anterior and posterior corpora callosa, and left anterior temporal lobe, and also in the bilateral corticospinal tracts, parahippocampal gyrus, and bilateral juxtapositional (previously known as supplemental motor) areas (p < 0.05). In the CSP cohort, a t-test comparing the MWF at the time of injury and 3 months later showed a significant increase in the overall MWF at follow-up (p < 0.005). These increases were greatest in the bilateral basal ganglia and deep white matter. MWF decreases were seen in more superficial white matter (p < 0.005).CONCLUSIONSIn this preliminary study, MWF was found to be increased in the brains of CSPs compared with the brains of controls, suggesting acute/chronic MWF alterations in CSPs from previous injuries. Increases in the MWF were also demonstrated in the brains of CSPs 3 months after the players sustained an mTBI. The full clinical significance of an increased MWF and whether this reflects axon neuropathology or disorderly remyelination leading to hypermyelination has yet to be determined. "
2018-03-01,"Brain injury occurs in two phases: the initial injury itself and a secondary cascade of precise immune-based neurochemical events. The secondary phase is typically functional in nature and characterized by delayed axonal injury with more axonal disconnections occurring than in the initial phase. Axonal injury occurs across the spectrum of disease severity, with subconcussive injury, especially when repetitive, now considered capable of producing significant neurological damage consistent with axonal injury seen in clinically evident concussion, despite no observable symptoms. This review is the first to introduce the concept of environmental subconcussive injury (ESCI) and sets out how secondary brain damage from ESCI once past the juncture of microglial activation appears to follow the same neuron-damaging pathway as secondary brain damage from conventional brain injury. The immune response associated with ESCI is strikingly similar to that mounted after conventional concussion. Specifically, microglial activation is followed closely by glutamate and calcium flux, excitotoxicity, reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) generation, lipid peroxidation, and mitochondrial dysfunction and energy crisis. ESCI damage also occurs in two phases, with the primary damage coming from microbiome injury (due to microbiome-altering events) and secondary damage (axonal injury) from progressive secondary neurochemical events. The concept of ESCI and the underlying mechanisms have profound implications for the understanding of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) etiology because it has previously been suggested that repetitive axonal injury may be the primary CTE pathogenesis in susceptible individuals and it is best correlated with lifetime brain trauma load. Taken together, it appears that susceptibility to brain injury and downstream neurodegenerative diseases, such as CTE, can be conceptualized as a continuum of brain resilience. At one end is optimal resilience, capable of launching effective responses to injury with spontaneous recovery, and at the other end is diminished resilience with a compromised ability to respond and/or heal appropriately. Modulating factors such as one's total cumulative and synergistic brain trauma load, bioavailability of key nutrients needed for proper functioning of restorative metabolic pathways (specifically those involved in the deactivation and clearance of metabolic by-products of brain injury) are key to ultimately determining one's brain resilience.

2018-03-01,"To determine whether or not automated FreeSurfer segmentation of brain regions considered important in repetitive head trauma can be analyzed accurately without manual correction. 3 T MR neuroimaging was performed with automated FreeSurfer segmentation and manual correction of 11 brain regions in former National Football League (NFL) players with neurobehavioral symptoms and in control subjects. Automated segmentation and manually-corrected volumes were compared using an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Linear mixed effects regression models were also used to estimate between-group mean volume comparisons and to correlate former NFL player brain volumes with neurobehavioral factors. Eighty-six former NFL players (55.2 ± 8.0 years) and 22 control subjects (57.0 ± 6.6 years) were evaluated. ICC was highly correlated between automated and manually-corrected corpus callosum volumes (0.911), lateral ventricular volumes (right 0.980, left 0.967), and amygdala-hippocampal complex volumes (right 0.713, left 0.731), but less correlated when amygdalae (right -0.170, left -0.090) and hippocampi (right 0.539, left 0.637) volumes were separately delineated and also less correlated for cingulate gyri volumes (right 0.639, left 0.351). Statistically significant differences between former NFL player and controls were identified in 8 of 11 regions with manual correction but in only 4 of 11 regions without such correction. Within NFL players, manually corrected brain volumes were significantly associated with 3 neurobehavioral factors, but a different set of 3 brain regions and neurobehavioral factor correlations was observed for brain region volumes segmented without manual correction. Automated FreeSurfer segmentation of the corpus callosum, lateral ventricles, and amygdala-hippocampus complex may be appropriate for analysis without manual correction. However, FreeSurfer segmentation of the amygdala, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus need further manual correction prior to performing group comparisons and correlations with neurobehavioral measures.

Participants were randomly assigned to read one of four vignettes that depicted a man who consulted his doctor because of memory problems. All vignettes described the same symptoms and diagnostic tests, but each of four groups read a different result: all tests normal (Normal); Alzheimer's disease (AD); Wernicke-Korsakoff Syndrome (WKS) associated with alcohol abuse; and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) associated with head injuries from playing football in high school and college. Measures included a word fragment completion task, a stereotype content scale, and an emotions scale. Results showed no differences in the number of death-related words generated in the word fragment completion task and no differences in assessment of competence across the four groups. Those in the Normal, AD, and CTE groups evaluated the man as warmer than those in the WKS group. Participants in the AD condition showed more empathy than those in the WKS group. There were no differences in pity or fear but the CTE condition produced more envy and admiration and the WKS condition produced more contempt. These results suggest that different forms of dementia elicit varying emotional and cognitive responses. "

We also review the literature for all such similar cases and briefly discuss the path-ophysiology of RO and the management of these pathological fractures. Spontaneous, pathological, bilateral neck femur fractures are increasingly being reported in chronic renal failure patients with high morbidity and mortality. These fractures tend to be missed as the patients are generally immobilized and bed ridden due to the renal disease.

2018-03-01,"The blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a continuous endothelial membrane within brain microvessels that has sealed cell-to-cell contacts and is sheathed by mural vascular cells and perivascular astrocyte end-feet. The BBB protects neurons from factors present in the systemic circulation and maintains the highly regulated CNS internal milieu, which is required for proper synaptic and neuronal functioning. BBB disruption allows influx into the brain of neurotoxic blood-derived debris, cells and microbial pathogens and is associated with inflammatory and immune responses, which can initiate multiple pathways of neurodegeneration. This Review discusses neuroimaging studies in the living human brain and post-mortem tissue as well as biomarker studies demonstrating BBB breakdown in Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, HIV-1-associated dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The pathogenic mechanisms by which BBB breakdown leads to neuronal injury, synaptic dysfunction, loss of neuronal connectivity and neurodegeneration are described. The importance of a healthy BBB for therapeutic drug delivery and the adverse effects of disease-initiated, pathological BBB breakdown in relation to brain delivery of neuropharmaceuticals are briefly discussed. Finally, future directions, gaps in the field and opportunities to control the course of neurological diseases by targeting the BBB are presented. "

2018-02-01,"To determine the occurrence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in young adult patients undergoing epilepsy surgery. Ten patients who underwent epilepsy surgery were randomly selected for this retrospective study. The patients were 18-45 years of age, had preoperative neuropsychological evaluation, and had 1 year postoperative follow-up. Microscopic sections from resections were evaluated for the presence of CTE with standard stains and antibodies to tau (clone AT8). The median age at resection was 32.5 years (range 23-43) and the median duration of seizures was 23.5 years (range 3-28). Eight had a history of head injury. Preoperative neuropsychological testing showed mild to moderate cognitive impairment in 8 patients (80%). Pathologic examination in one patient showed focal sparse tau-immunoreactive lesions along descending rami and cortical gyral depths of the resected frontal lobe. Nine patients had no evidence of CTE. All focal cortical resections showed variable subpial and subcortical gliosis commonly identified in patients with chronic seizure disorders. The present small retrospective observational study suggests that CTE may occur, but appears uncommon, in young adult patients undergoing surgical treatment for drug-resistant focal epilepsy. The significance of these findings requires further investigation to define the relative importance of tau accumulation in younger adult patients with drug-resistant focal epilepsy and cognitive decline.

2018-02-01,"The mechanisms underpinning concussion, traumatic brain injury, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and the relationships between these disorders, are poorly understood. We examined post-mortem brains from teenage athletes in the acute-subacute period after mild closed-head impact injury and found astrocytosis, myelinated axonopathy, microvascular injury, perivascular neuroinflammation, and phosphorylated tau protein pathology. To investigate causal mechanisms, we developed a mouse model of lateral closed-head impact injury that uses momentum transfer to induce traumatic head acceleration. Unanaesthetized mice subjected to unilateral impact exhibited abrupt onset, transient course, and rapid resolution of a concussion-like syndrome characterized by altered arousal, contralateral hemiparesis, truncal ataxia, locomotor and balance impairments, and neurobehavioural deficits. Experimental impact injury was associated with axonopathy, blood-brain barrier disruption, astrocytosis, microgliosis (with activation of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells, TREM2), monocyte infiltration, and phosphorylated tauopathy in cerebral cortex ipsilateral and subjacent to impact. Phosphorylated tauopathy was detected in ipsilateral axons by 24 h, bilateral axons and soma by 2 weeks, and distant cortex bilaterally at 5.5 months post-injury. Impact pathologies co-localized with serum albumin extravasation in the brain that was diagnostically detectable in living mice by dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI. These pathologies were also accompanied by early, persistent, and bilateral impairment in axonal conduction velocity in the hippocampus and defective long-term potentiation of synaptic neurotransmission in the medial prefrontal cortex, brain regions distant from acute brain injury. Surprisingly, acute neurobehavioural deficits at the time of injury did not correlate with blood-brain barrier disruption, microgliosis, neuroinflammation, phosphorylated tauopathy, or electrophysiological dysfunction. Furthermore, concussion-like deficits were observed after impact injury, but not after blast exposure under experimental conditions matched for head kinematics. Computational modelling showed that impact injury generated focal point loading on the head and seven-fold greater peak shear stress in the brain compared to blast exposure. Moreover, intracerebral shear stress peaked before onset of gross head motion. By comparison, blast induced distributed force loading on the head and diffuse, lower magnitude shear stress in the brain. We conclude that force loading mechanics at the time of injury shape acute neurobehavioural responses, structural brain damage, and neuropathological sequelae triggered by neurotrauma. These results indicate that closed-head impact injuries, independent of concussive signs, can induce traumatic brain injury as well as early pathologies and functional sequelae associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. These results also shed light on the origins of concussion and relationship to traumatic brain injury and its aftermath.awx350media15713427811001. "
2018-02-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repetitive mild brain trauma. CTE, previously termed ""dementia pugilistica,"" has been identified in American football, ice hockey, baseball, rugby and soccer players, boxers, wrestlers, and military personnel exposed to blast and other traumatic brain injuries. There is often a long latency period between an individual's exposure to repetitive brain trauma and the clinical symptoms of CTE. The pathology of CTE is characterized by a progression from isolated focal perivascular hyperphosphorylated tau lesions in the cerebral cortex to a widespread tauopathy that involves diffuse cortical and medial temporal lobe regions. We hypothesize that the spread of tau from focal perivascular lesions to a widespread tauopathy occurs as a result of intraneuronal and intrasynaptic prion-like protein templating, as well as tau secretion and propagation along glymphatic and cerebrospinal fluid pathways.

2018-02-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are devastating neurological disorders, whose complex relationship is not completely understood. Cerebrovascular pathology, a key element in both conditions, could represent a mechanistic link between Aβ/tau deposition after TBI and the development of post concussive syndrome, dementia and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In addition to debilitating acute effects, TBI-induced neurovascular injuries accelerate amyloid β (Aβ) production and perivascular accumulation, arterial stiffness, tau hyperphosphorylation and tau/Aβ-induced blood brain barrier damage, giving rise to a deleterious feed-forward loop. We postulate that TBI can initiate cerebrovascular pathology, which is causally involved in the development of multiple forms of neurodegeneration including AD-like dementias. In this review, we will explore how novel biomarkers, animal and human studies with a focus on cerebrovascular dysfunction are contributing to the understanding of the consequences of TBI on the development of AD-like pathology.

2018-02-01,"There is increasing recognition that traumatic brain injury (TBI) may initiate long-term neurodegenerative processes, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, insight into the mechanisms transforming an initial biomechanical injury into a neurodegenerative process remain elusive, partly as a consequence of the paucity of informative pre-clinical models. This study shows the functional, whole brain imaging and neuropathological consequences at up to one year survival from single severe TBI by controlled cortical impact in mice. TBI mice displayed persistent sensorimotor and cognitive deficits. Longitudinal T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed progressive ipsilateral (il) cortical, hippocampal and striatal volume loss, with diffusion tensor imaging demonstrating decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) at up to one year in the il-corpus callosum (CC: -30%) and external capsule (EC: -21%). Parallel neuropathological studies indicated reduction in neuronal density, with evidence of microgliosis and astrogliosis in the il-cortex, with further evidence of microgliosis and astrogliosis in the il-thalamus. One year after TBI there was also a decrease in FA in the contralateral (cl) CC (-17%) and EC (-13%), corresponding to histopathological evidence of white matter loss (cl-CC: -68%; cl-EC: -30%) associated with ongoing microgliosis and astrogliosis. These findings indicate that a single severe TBI induces bilateral, long-term and progressive neuropathology at up to one year after injury. These observations support this model as a suitable platform for exploring the mechanistic link between acute brain injury and late and persistent neurodegeneration. "
2018-02-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major worldwide neurological disorder of epidemic proportions. To date, there are still no FDA-approved therapies to treat any forms of TBI. Encouragingly, there are emerging data showing that biofluid-based TBI biomarker tests have the potential to diagnose the presence of TBI of different severities including concussion, and to predict outcome. Areas covered: The authors provide an update on the current knowledge of TBI biomarkers, including protein biomarkers for neuronal cell body injury (UCH-L1, NSE), astroglial injury (GFAP, S100B), neuronal cell death (αII-spectrin breakdown products), axonal injury (NF proteins), white matter injury (MBP), post-injury neurodegeneration (total Tau and phospho-Tau), post-injury autoimmune response (brain antigen-targeting autoantibodies), and other emerging non-protein biomarkers. The authors discuss biomarker evidence in TBI diagnosis, outcome prognosis and possible identification of post-TBI neurodegernative diseases (e.g. chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease), and as theranostic tools in pre-clinical and clinical settings. Expert commentary: A spectrum of biomarkers is now at or near the stage of formal clinical validation of their diagnostic and prognostic utilities in the management of TBI of varied severities including concussions. TBI biomarkers could serve as a theranostic tool in facilitating drug development and treatment monitoring. "

The most common abnormalities include cerebral volume loss, enlargement of the cavum of the septum pellucidum, cerebral microhemorrhages, and white matter signal abnormalities, all of which have poor sensitivity and specificity. Advanced imaging modalities, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), blood oxygen level dependent functional MR Imaging (BOLD fMRI), MR spectroscopy, perfusion imaging, positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and magnetoencephalography detect physiologic abnormalities in symptomatic patients and, although currently in the investigation phase, may become useful in the clinical arena.

2018-02-01,"Currently, only presumptive diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can be made in living patients. We present a modality that may be instrumental to the definitive diagnosis of CTE in living patients based on brain autopsy confirmation of [F-18]FDDNP-PET findings in an American football player with CTE. [F-18]FDDNP-PET imaging was performed 52 mo before the subject's death. Relative distribution volume parametric images and binding values were determined for cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Upon death, the brain was examined to identify the topographic distribution of neurodegenerative changes. Correlation between neuropathology and [F-18]FDDNP-PET binding patterns was performed using Spearman rank-order correlation. Mood, behavioral, motor, and cognitive changes were consistent with chronic traumatic myeloencephalopathy with a 22-yr lifetime risk exposure to American football. There were tau, amyloid, and TDP-43 neuropathological substrates in the brain with a differential topographically selective distribution. [F-18]FDDNP-PET binding levels correlated with brain tau deposition (rs = 0.59, P = .02), with highest relative distribution volumes in the parasagittal and paraventricular regions of the brain and the brain stem. No correlation with amyloid or TDP-43 deposition was observed. [F-18]FDDNP-PET signals may be consistent with neuropathological patterns of tau deposition in CTE, involving areas that receive the maximal shearing, angular-rotational acceleration-deceleration forces in American football players, consistent with distinctive and differential topographic vulnerability and selectivity of CTE beyond brain cortices, also involving midbrain and limbic areas. Future studies are warranted to determine whether differential and selective [F-18]FDDNP-PET may be useful in establishing a diagnosis of CTE in at-risk patients. "
2018-02-01,"The pathological features of Alzheimer's disease are senile plaques which are aggregates of β-amyloid peptides and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. Neurofibrillary tangles are aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, and these induce various other neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In the case of Alzheimer's disease, the measurement of neurofibrillary tangles associated with cognitive decline is suitable for differential diagnosis, disease progression assessment, and to monitor the effects of therapeutic treatment. This review discusses considerations for the development of tau ligands for imaging and summarizes the results of the first-in-human and preclinical studies of the tau tracers that have been developed thus far. The development of tau ligands for imaging studies will be helpful for differential diagnosis and for the development of therapeutic treatments for tauopathies including Alzheimer's disease. "
2018-02-01,"Studies using traditional treatment strategies for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) have produced limited clinical success. Interest in treatment for mild TBI is at an all time high due to its association with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases, yet therapeutic options remain limited. Traditional pharmaceutical interventions have failed to transition to the clinic for the treatment of mild TBI. As such, many pre-clinical studies are now implementing non-pharmaceutical therapies for TBI. These studies have demonstrated promise, particularly those that modulate secondary injury cascades activated after injury. Because no TBI therapy has been discovered for mild injury, researchers now look to pharmaceutical supplementation in an attempt to foster success in human clinical trials. Non-traditional therapies, such as acupuncture and even music therapy are being considered to combat the neuropsychiatric symptoms of TBI. In this review, we highlight alternative approaches that have been studied in clinical and pre-clinical studies of TBI, and other related forms of neural injury. The purpose of this review is to stimulate further investigation into novel and innovative approaches that can be used to treat the mechanisms and symptoms of mild TBI. "

2018-01-01,"Thalamic atrophy has been associated with exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHI) in professional fighters. The aim of this study is to investigate whether or not age at first exposure (AFE) to RHI is associated with thalamic volume in symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Eighty-six symptomatic former NFL players (mean age = 54.9 ± 7.9 years) were included. T1-weighted data were acquired on a 3T magnetic resonance imager, and thalamic volumes were derived using FreeSurfer. Mood and behavior, psychomotor speed, and visual and verbal memory were assessed. The association between thalamic volume and AFE to playing football and to number of years playing was calculated. Decreased thalamic volume was associated with more years of play (left: p = 0.03; right: p = 0.03). Younger AFE was associated with decreased right thalamic volume (p = 0.014). This association remained significant after adjusting for total years of play. Decreased left thalamic volume was associated with worse visual memory (p = 0.014), whereas increased right thalamic volume was associated with fewer mood and behavior symptoms (p = 0.003). In our sample of symptomatic former NFL players at risk for CTE, total years of play and AFE were associated with decreased thalamic volume. The effect of AFE on right thalamic volume was almost twice as strong as the effect of total years of play. Our findings confirm previous reports of an association between thalamic volume and exposure to RHI. They suggest further that younger AFE may result in smaller thalamic volume later in life. "
2018-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by head trauma. Diagnosis of this disease is difficult as reliable biomarkers have not been established and often this clinical entity is underappreciated with poor recognition of its clinical presentations (Lenihan and Jordan, 2015). The definitive diagnosis of CTE is determined by identification of neurofibrillary tangles in the perivascular space around the sulci in postmortem tissue (McKee et al., 2015). However, performing brain biopsies searching for neurofibrillary tangles is not a feasible option for early diagnosis. Thus, diagnosis of suspected CTE in the living has been based on clinical suspicion using proposed research criteria of clinical presentations. In addition, neuroimaging techniques have shown some promise in assisting diagnosis. Clinically, CTE is more commonly known to be associated with memory impairment and executive function disorder (Stern et al., 2013). However, here, we present two unique cases of prior professional football players where behavioral changes were the first identifying factors in clinical presentation and discuss possible neuroimaging options to help with CTE diagnosis. Because behavioral changes can be mistaken for other neuropsychological diseases, recognizing differing clinical constellations is critical to early diagnosis, early intervention, and improving patient care in suspected CTE.

2019-07-01,"An estimated 5.3 million Americans are living with a disability from a traumatic brain injury (TBI). There is emerging evidence of the detrimental effects from repeated mild TBIs (rmTBIs). rmTBI manifests its own unique set of behavioral and neuropathological changes. A subset of individuals exposed to rmTBI develop permanent behavioral and pathological consequences, defined postmortem as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We have combined components of two classic rodent models of TBI, the controlled cortical impact model and the weight drop model, to develop a repeated mild closed head injury (rmCHI) that produces long-term deficits in several behaviors that correlate with neuropathological changes. Mice receiving rmCHI performed differently from 1-hit or sham controls on the elevated plus maze; these deficits persist up to 6 months postinjury (MPI). rmCHI mice performed worse than 1-hit and control sham mice at 2 MPI and 6 MPI on the Morris water maze. Mice receiving rmCHI exhibited significant atrophy of the corpus callosum at both 2 MPI and 6 MPI, as assessed by stereological volume analysis. Stereological analysis also revealed significant loss of cortical neurons in comparison with 1-hit and controls. Moreover, both of these pathological changes correlated with behavioral impairments. In human tau transgenic mice, rmCHI induced increases in hyperphosphorylated paired helical filament 1 tau in the hippocampus. This suggests that strategies to restore myelination or reduce neuronal loss may ameliorate the behavioral deficits observed following rmCHI and that rmCHI may model chronic traumatic encephalopathy in human tau mice.

2018-10-01,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease thought to be caused by repeated head impacts and associated with deficits in cognition. Despite research and media attention, there is little science-based information available for the public. Also unclear is what the public and particularly parents of youth athletes know about CTE. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) surveyed parents of young athletes to fill this gap. CDC analysed 12 CTE-related questions that appeared in Porter Novelli Public Service's 2017 SummerStyles opinion survey. Analyses focused on 674 parents of children who play in a youth sports programme. Half of parents had at least one child who plays contact sports. About one-third of respondents reported being somewhat or very familiar with CTE. Most parents (81.7%) have not received educational materials on CTE from a school or sports programme. Healthcare providers were the preferred source of information about CTE (70%), followed by sports coaches (54%). This analysis identified information needs related to CTE among parents of young athletes. These findings can be used by health educators to tailor educational materials to meet information needs. Educational materials that emphasize potential prevention strategies and symptom onset may be beneficial. "
2017-11-01,"Repeated traumatic brain injuries (rmTBI) are frequently associated with debilitating neuropsychiatric conditions such as cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder. We tested the hypothesis that repeated mild traumatic brain injury impairs spatial memory and enhances anxiety-like behaviour. We used a between groups design using single (smTBI) or repeated (rmTBI) controlled cranial closed skull impacts to mice, compared to a control group. We assessed the effects of smTBI and rmTBI using measures of motor performance (Rotarod Test [RT]), anxiety-like behaviour (Elevated Plus Maze [EPM] and Open Field [OF] tests), and spatial memory (Morris Water Maze [MWM]) within 12 days of the final injury. In separate groups of mice, astrocytosis and microglial activation were assessed 24 hours after the final injury using GFAP and IBA-1 immunohistochemistry. RmTBI impaired spatial memory in the MWM and increased anxiety-like behaviour in the EPM and OFT. In addition, rmTBI elevated GFAP and IBA-1 immunohistochemistry throughout the mouse brain. RmTBI produced astrocytosis and microglial activation, and elicited impaired spatial memory and anxiety-like behaviour. rmTBI produces acute cognitive and anxiety-like disturbances associated with inflammatory changes in brain regions involved in spatial memory and anxiety.

2019-11-01,"Sports activities associated with repetitive cranial trauma have become a fad and are popular in gyms and even among children. It is important to consistently characterize the consequences of such sports activities in order to better advise society on the real risks to the central nervous system. We present the case of a former boxer reporting cognitive and behavioral symptoms that began six years after his retirement as a boxer, evolving progressively with parkinsonian and cerebellar features suggestive of probable chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Using our case as a paradigm, we extended the range of differential diagnosis of CTE, including corticobasal degeneration, multiple system atrophy, vitamin B12 deficiency, neurosyphilis, frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease. As atividades esportivas associadas ao trauma craniano repetitivo tornaram-se uma moda e são populares nas academias e entre as crianças.

2018-05-01,"The leading cause of death in the juvenile population is trauma, and in particular neurotrauma. The juvenile brain response to neurotrauma is not completely understood. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been shown to contribute to injury expansion and behavioral deficits in adult rodents and furthermore has been seen in adult postmortem human brains diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Whether endoplasmic reticulum stress is increased in juveniles with traumatic brain injury (TBI) is poorly delineated. We investigated this important topic using a juvenile rat controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. We proposed that ER stress would be significantly increased in juvenile rats following TBI and that this would correlate with behavioral deficits using a juvenile rat model. A juvenile rat (postnatal day 28) CCI model was used. Binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) were measured at 4 h in the ipsilateral pericontusion cortex. Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1α was measured at 48 h and tau kinase measured at 1 week and 30 days. At 4 h following injury, BiP and CHOP (markers of ER stress) were significantly elevated in rats exposed to TBI. We also found that HIF-1α was significantly upregulated 48 h following TBI showing delayed hypoxia. The early ER stress activation was additionally asso-ciated with the activation of a known tau kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β), by 1 week. Tau oligomers measured by R23 were significantly increased by 30 days following TBI. The biochemical changes following TBI were associated with increased impulsive-like or anti-anxiety behavior measured with the elevated plus maze, deficits in short-term memory measured with novel object recognition, and deficits in spatial memory measured with the Morris water maze in juvenile rats exposed to TBI. These results show that ER stress was increased early in juvenile rats exposed to TBI, that these rats developed tau oligomers over the course of 30 days, and that they had significant short-term and spatial memory deficits following injury.

2019-05-01,"Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) in the form of -amyloid (A) deposits is important not only in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Down's syndrome (DS) but also as a 'co-pathology' in disorders such as dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). To compare cortical and hippocampal degeneration in different disorders, the spatial patterns of the diffuse, primi-tive, and classic A deposits were studied in regions of frontal and temporal cortex in five neurodegenerative disorders, viz. AD, DS, DLB, CBD, and CTE using spatial pattern analysis. In all disorders, the A deposits were clustered and in a proportion of brain regions, the clusters were regularly distributed parallel to the tissue boundary. Cluster dimensions in the cortex, measured parallel to the pia mater, were frequently in the range 400-800 m suggesting a spatial association with the cortico-cortical pathways. Differences were also observed among disorders, the diffuse A deposits being more frequently distributed in regular clusters in AD while cluster sizes of the diffuse and primitive deposits were significantly smaller in CTE. The data suggest considerable similarities in the spatial patterns of A deposits in different disorders, regardless of the clinical or pathological setting, which suggests that the spread of A via neuro-anatomical pathways may be common to several disorders.

2019-03-01,"Head impacts that transfer mechanical energy to the skull and create brain injuries have unique dynamic responses and brain tissue trauma characteristics. The magnitude of the impact energy and how it is transmitted creates three-dimensional linear and rotational accelerations of the head, resulting in unique strains on brain tissue. Biomechanical investigations of head injuries in contact sports have historically focused on attenuating energy transfer to the skull and brain. Typically, severe life-threatening events are caused by high-energy impact events that result in anatomic damage. Protective equipment attenuates energy transmission to neural tissues to decrease the risk of structural damage. In addition to reducing risk of skull fracture, helmets work by increasing impact compliance, to decrease the magnitude of the head's dynamic response and increase the duration of the event. This strategy helps prevent severe traumatic brain injuries and shifts the risk to concussion and repetitive head impact exposure. Metabolic, cellular, and physiologic responses characterize cumulative brain trauma that may manifest years later. Relying on the presence of symptoms to establish injury is subjective and limited in capturing the risks associated with neural tissue trauma. To more effectively capture brain injury risks in contact sports, we present the concept of brain trauma profiling, involving impact magnitude, frequency, interval, and duration of exposure. Brain trauma profiling captures and describes the cumulative and acute trauma-associated injury risks unique to each sport, level of play, and player position. "
2019-03-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neuropathologic condition that has been described in individuals who have been exposed to repetitive head impacts, including concussions and subconcussive trauma. CTE cannot currently be diagnosed during life. Clinical symptoms of CTE (including changes in mood, behavior, and cognition) are nonspecific and may develop after a latency phase following the injuries. Differential diagnosis based solely on clinical features is, therefore, difficult. For example, some younger patients who do not experience the latency phase (i.e., symptoms of CTE may begin while still being exposed to the repetitive head impacts) may be clinically diagnosed with postconcussive syndrome, a vaguely defined condition that is described in a minority of concussed patients. Some older patients whose initial features of CTE include memory and executive dysfunction and progress to impaired activities of daily living may be clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer disease or another dementia. Although concussions are common in athletes and nonathletes, contact/collision sport athletes, such as boxers, American football players, and ice hockey players, are at greater risk of exposure to both concussion and repetitive subconcussive head impacts. Biomarkers for CTE pathophysiology would be of great value to study and improve our understanding of when and how the disease process starts and develops, as well as how it can be prevented or treated. Here, we review the literature regarding fluid biomarkers for repetitive subconcussive impacts, concussion, postconcussive syndrome, and CTE. We also discuss technical issues and potential pathways forward regarding how to move the most promising biomarker candidates into clinical laboratory practice. "
2019-03-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with repetitive head impact exposure, such as that resulting from sports-related concussive and subconcussive brain trauma. Currently, the only way to diagnose CTE is by using neuropathologic markers obtained postmortem. To diagnose CTE earlier, so that possible treatment interventions may be employed, there is a need to develop noninvasive in vivo biomarkers of CTE. Neuroimaging provides promising biomarkers for the diagnosis of CTE and may also help elucidate pathophysiologic changes that occur with chronic sports-related brain injury. To describe the use of neuroimaging as presumed biomarkers of CTE, this chapter focuses on only those studies that report the chronic stages of sports-related brain injury, as opposed to previous chapters that described neuroimaging in the context of acute and subacute injury. Studies using positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy will be discussed for contact/collision sports such as American football, boxing, mixed martial arts, rugby, and soccer, in which repetitive head impacts are common.

2019-03-01,"An evolutionary perspective helps explain a conundrum faced by sports neurologists: why is the human brain dependent on physical activity to function optimally, yet simultaneously susceptible to harm from particular types of athletics? For millions of years, human bodies and brains co-evolved to meet the physical and cognitive demands of the uniquely human subsistence strategy of hunting and gathering. Natural selection favored bodies with adaptations for endurance-based physical activity patterns, whereas brains were selected to be big and powerful to navigate the complex cultural and ecologic landscapes of hunter-gatherers. Human brains require physical activity to function optimally because their physiology evolved among individuals who were rarely able to avoid regular physical activity. Moreover, because energy from food was limited, human brains, like most energetically costly physiologic systems, evolved to require stimuli from physical activity to adjust capacity to demand. Consequently, human brains are poorly adapted to excessive physical inactivity. In addition, while brain enlargement during human evolution was vital to successful hunting and gathering, it came at the cost of a decreased ability to withstand brain accelerations and decelerations, which commonly occur during contact/collision sports.

2019-03-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repetitive head trauma, including concussion and subconcussion. CTE was first recognized in boxers nearly a century ago as ""dementia pugilistica"" or ""punch drunk,"" but has been recently identified in contact sports athletes (including American football, ice hockey, soccer, baseball, rugby, boxing, and wrestling) and military veterans exposed to blast. Similar to many other neurodegenerative diseases, CTE is diagnosed conclusively only by neuropathologic examination of brain tissue. CTE is characterized by the buildup of hyperphosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles, abnormal neurites, and inclusions in astrocytes around small blood vessels with a tendency to occur in clusters at the sulcal depths of the cortex. Using the McKee criteria, a consensus panel of expert neuropathologists confirmed CTE as a unique neurodegenerative disease with a pathognomonic CTE lesion that has only been found in individuals exposed to brain trauma. Recently, 177 instances of CTE were reported in a convenience sample of 202 former American football players, including 110 of 111 former National Football League players (99%), 48 of 53 former college football players (91%), and 3 of 14 former high school players (21%), by far the largest case series ever reported. Significant increases in active microglia and inflammation also occur after repetitive head impact injury and in CTE. A preliminary study showed that inflammatory cytokines were elevated in the brain tissue and cerebrospinal fluid of individuals with pathologically confirmed CTE compared to controls and individuals with Alzheimer disease, which may some day be useful in diagnosis of CTE during life. Although many fundamental questions remain to be answered regarding CTE, postmortem analysis of tissue from brain donors and tissue-based research have accelerated and expanded our current understanding of CTE and its pathogenesis. Guided by the neuropathologic findings, current research efforts are underway to develop biomarkers to diagnose CTE and effective ways to treat the disorder during life. "
2019-05-01,"Exposure to repetitive head impacts from contact sport participation (e.g., American football, boxing, soccer) is associated with the neurodegenerative disorder known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The neuropathology of CTE is becoming well defined, and diagnostic criteria have been developed and are being refined. The critical next step in this emerging field is the diagnosis of CTE during life. The objective of this chapter is to describe what is currently known about the clinical presentation and in vivo diagnosis of CTE. This chapter reviews studies in which clinical manifestation of CTE was examined through retrospective telephone interviews with informants of individuals whose brains were donated and were diagnosed with CTE through neuropathologic examination. In vivo research examining the long-term neurobehavioral consequences of repetitive head impacts is also reviewed, followed by a comparison of the existing provisional clinical diagnostic criteria for CTE, as well as preliminary research on possible fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers. An illustrative case study of CTE is presented, and the chapter concludes with a discussion of gaps in knowledge and future directions. "
2019-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein in the depths of one or more cortical sulci. Controversy over the risk of CTE and neurologic disorders later in life among contact sport athletes has taken hold in the public spotlight, most notably in American football. Players, parents, coaches, and legislators have taken action based on the commonly held notion that contact sports invariably lead to neurodegenerative disorders. However, to fully understand the science behind this assumed association, a critical appraisal of the evidence is warranted. With regards to CTE in sports, the objectives of the current report are to: 1) describe the history of CTE, 2) review current CTE definitions, 3) critically evaluate the empiric data, divided into all contact sports and exclusively American football, and 4) summarize notable themes for future research.

2019-08-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of disability and produces a wide range of cognitive, emotional, and physical consequences. The impact of TBI on cognition is among the most important questions in this field but remains incompletely understood. The immediate cognitive effects of concussion, while usually short-lived, may be profound and lasting in some individuals, and long-term sequelae of TBI may include dementia of several varieties including post-traumatic leukoencephalopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Alzheimer's disease. Whereas the etiopathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction after TBI remains uncertain, a reasonable point to begin is a focus on the white matter of the brain, where the neuropathological lesion known as diffuse axonal injury (DAI) is routinely identified. White matter is not typically accorded the significance granted to cortical gray matter in discussions of cognitive dysfunction and dementia, but increasing evidence is accumulating to suggest that cognitive decline after TBI is a direct result of white matter injury, and that lesions in this brain component are crucial in the sequence of events leading ultimately to dementia of several types. In this review, we consider the topic of white matter and cognition in TBI, beginning with DAI and proceeding to the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction and dementia that can follow. A brief review of possible therapeutic options will also be offered, including the use of anti-inflammatory agents and the exploitation of white matter plasticity, to treat acute and post-acute injuries, and lower the incidence of dementia resulting from TBI.

2020-02-01,"Our group has shown that in vivo tau brain binding patterns from FDDNP-PET scans in retired professional football players with suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy differ from those of tau and amyloid aggregate binding observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and cognitively-intact controls. To compare these findings with those from military personnel with histories of mild traumatic brain injury(mTBI). FDDNP-PET brain scans were compared among 7 military personnel and 15 retired players with mTBI histories and cognitive and/or mood symptoms, 24 AD patients, and 28 cognitively-intact controls. Nonparametric ANCOVAs with Tukey-Kramer adjusted post-hoc comparisons were used to test for significant differences in regional FDDNP binding among subject groups. FDDNP brain binding was higher in military personnel compared to controls in the amygdala, midbrain, thalamus, pons, frontal and anterior and posterior cingulate regions (p < 0.01-0.0001). Binding patterns in the military personnel were similar to those of the players except for the amygdala and striatum (binding higher in players; p = 0.02-0.003). Compared with the AD group, the military personnel showed higher binding in the midbrain (p = 0.0008) and pons (p = 0.002) and lower binding in the medial temporal, lateral temporal, and parietal regions (all p = 0.02). This first study of in vivo tau and amyloid brain signals in military personnel with histories of mTBI shows binding patterns similar to those of retired football players and distinct from the binding patterns in AD and normal aging, suggesting the potential value of FDDNP-PET for early detection and treatment monitoring in varied at-risk populations.

2019-07-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is considered to be a progressive neurodegenerative disease caused by mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Recently there has been a significant amount of media attention surrounding the commonness of CTE in professional athletes, particularly American football, based on several postmortem case series. However, despite the persuasive claims made by the media about CTE, research on the disease and the effects of mTBI in general remain in its infancy. Commonly cited case series studying CTE are limited by methodological biases, pathological inconsistencies, insufficient clinical data, and a reliance on inherently biased postmortem data. These case series do not allow for the collection of any epidemiological data and are not representative of the general population. The exaggerated assumptions and assertions taken from these studies run the risk of creating a self-fulfilling prophecy for individuals who believe they are at risk and have the potential to negatively influence sports-related policymaking. This review outlines the status and limitations of recent CTE case series and calls for future prospective, longitudinal studies to further characterize the pathological and clinical hallmarks of CTE.

2019-12-01,"Hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a key pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and Parkinson's disease. The essential trace element zinc exacerbates tauopathy in vitro as well as in a Drosophila model of AD. However, the interaction has never been assessed behaviorally or biochemically in mammals. Zinc supplementation is prevalent in society, finding use as a treatment for macular degeneration and cataracts, and is also taken as an immune system booster with high levels appearing in multivitamins marketed toward the elderly. Using a transgenic mouse model that contains the human gene for tau protein (P301L), we assessed the effects of excess chronic zinc supplementation on tau pathology. Behavioral tests included nest building, circadian rhythm, Morris Water Maze, fear conditioning, and open field. Biochemically, total tau and Ser396 phosphorylation were assessed using western blot. Number of tangles were assessed by Thioflavin-S and free zinc levels were assessed by Zinpyr-1. Tau mice demonstrated behavioral deficits compared to control mice. Zinc supplementation exacerbated tauopathic deficits in circadian rhythm, nesting behavior, and Morris Water Maze. Biochemically, zinc-supplemented tau mice showed increased phosphorylation at pSer396. Zinc supplementation in tau mice also increased tangle numbers in the hippocampus while decreasing free-zinc levels, demonstrating that tangles were sequestering zinc. These results show that zinc intensified the deficits in behavior and biochemistry caused by tau. "
2019-07-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an established risk factor for the development of neurodegeneration and dementia late in life. Repetitive mild TBI (r-mTBI) is directly associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by focal perivascular to widespread Alzheimer-type neurofibrillary pathology of hyperphosphorylated tau. Studies in animal models have shown hyperphosphorylation of tau after TBI. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TBI leads to tau pathology are not understood. In this study, we employed western blots and immunohistochemistry to test, in triple-transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (3xTg-AD), the effect of r-mTBI on tau hyperphosphorylation and activation of asparaginyl endopeptidase (AEP), a cysteine proteinase which is known to be involved in tau hyperphosphorylation. We found that the level of active AEP was increased and correlated with the level of tau hyperphosphorylation following r-mTBI, and that fimbria showed increased immunoreactivity to phospho-tau. In addition, inhibitor 2 of protein phosphatase 2A (I2PP2A) was translocated from neuronal nucleus to the cytoplasm and colocalized with hyperphosphorylated tau. These data suggest the involvement of AEP-I2PP2A-PP2A-ptau pathway in tau pathology in TBI. "
2019-06-01,"There is growing genetic and proteomic data highlighting the complexity of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Greater use of unbiased ""omics"" approaches is being increasingly recognized as essential for the future development of effective AD research, that need to better reflect the multiple distinct pathway abnormalities that can drive AD pathology. The track record of success in AD clinical trials thus far has been very poor. In part, this high failure rate has been related to the premature translation of highly successful results in animal models that mirror only limited aspects of AD pathology to humans. We highlight our recent efforts to increase use of human tissue to gain a better understanding of the AD pathogenesis subtype variety and to develop several distinct therapeutic approaches tailored to address this diversity. These therapeutic approaches include the blocking of the Aβ/apoE interaction, stimulation of innate immunity, and the simultaneous blocking of Aβ/tau oligomer toxicity. We believe that future successful therapeutic approaches will need to be combined to better reflect the complexity of the abnormal pathways triggered in AD pathogenesis. "
2018-11-01,"There is tremendous recent interest in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in former collision sport athletes, civilians, and military veterans. This critical review places important recent research results into a historical context. In 2015, preliminary consensus criteria were developed for defining the neuropathology of CTE, which substantially narrowed the pathology previously reported to be characteristic. There are no agreed upon clinical criteria for diagnosis, although sets of criteria have been proposed for research purposes. A prevailing theory is that CTE is an inexorably progressive neurodegenerative disease within the molecular classification of the tauopathies. However, historical and recent evidence suggests that CTE, as it is presented in the literature, might not be pathologically or clinically progressive in a substantial percentage of people. At present, it is not known whether the emergence, course, or severity of clinical symptoms can be predicted by specific combinations of neuropathologies, thresholds for accumulation of pathology, or regional distributions of pathologies. More research is needed to determine the extent to which the neuropathology ascribed to long-term effects of neurotrauma is static, progressive, or both. Disambiguating the pathology from the broad array of clinical features that have been reported in recent studies might facilitate and accelerate research- and improve understanding of CTE. "
2018-06-01,"Tau is a microtubule-associated protein heavily implicated in neurodegenerative diseases collectively known as tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Phosphorylation of tau at Thr231 allows for the isomerization of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) into distinct cis and trans conformations. Cis, but not trans, p-tau is detectable not only in Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but also right after traumatic brain injury depending on injury severity and frequency both in humans and animal models. Cis p-tau is not only neurotoxic but also spreads from a neuron to another in a prion-like fashion, functioning as a primary driver of neurodegeneration, which can be effectively neutralized by cis p-tau antibody. This represents an exciting new opportunity for understanding disease development and developing early biomarkers and effective therapies of tauopathies. "
2018-01-01,"Over the course of most common neurodegenerative diseases the amygdala accumulates pathologically misfolded proteins. Misfolding of 1 protein in aged brains often is accompanied by the misfolding of other proteins, suggesting synergistic mechanisms. The multiplicity of pathogenic processes in human amygdalae has potentially important implications for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease, Lewy body diseases, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, primary age-related tauopathy, and hippocampal sclerosis, and for the biomarkers used to diagnose those diseases. Converging data indicate that the amygdala may represent a preferential locus for a pivotal transition from a relatively benign clinical condition to a more aggressive disease wherein multiple protein species are misfolded. Thus, understanding of amygdalar pathobiology may yield insights relevant to diagnoses and therapies; it is, however, a complex and imperfectly defined brain region. Here, we review aspects of amygdalar anatomy, connectivity, vasculature, and pathologic involvement in neurodegenerative diseases with supporting data from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center autopsy cohort. Immunohistochemical staining of amygdalae for Aβ, Tau, α-synuclein, and TDP-43 highlight the often-coexisting pathologies. We suggest that the amygdala may represent an ""incubator"" for misfolded proteins and that it is possible that misfolded amygdalar protein species are yet to be discovered. "
2018-01-01,"We report the clinical, neuroimaging, and neuropathologic characteristics of 2 patients who developed early onset dementia after a moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Neuropathological evaluation revealed abundant β-amyloid neuritic and cored plaques, diffuse β-amyloid plaques, and frequent hyperphosphorylated-tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) involving much of the cortex, including insula and mammillary bodies in both cases. Case 1 additionally showed NFTs in both the superficial and deep cortical layers, occasional perivascular and depth-of-sulci NFTs, and parietal white matter rarefaction, which corresponded with decreased parietal fiber tracts observed on ex vivo MRI. Case 2 additionally showed NFT predominance in the superficial layers of the cortex, hypothalamus and brainstem, diffuse Lewy bodies in the cortex, amygdala and brainstem, and intraneuronal TDP-43 inclusions. The neuropathologic diagnoses were atypical Alzheimer disease (AD) with features of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and white matter loss (Case 1), and atypical AD, dementia with Lewy bodies and coexistent TDP-43 pathology (Case 2). These findings support an epidemiological association between TBI and dementia and further characterize the variety of misfolded proteins that may accumulate after TBI. Analyses with comprehensive clinical, imaging, genetic, and neuropathological data are required to characterize the full clinicopathological spectrum associated with dementias occurring after moderate-severe TBI. "
2018-01-01,"Quantitative proteomics of postmortem human brain can identify dysfunctional proteins that contribute to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia. Similar studies in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are limited, therefore we hypothesized that proteomic sequencing of CTE frontal cortex brain homogenates from varying CTE pathologic stages may provide important new insights into this disorder. Quantitative proteomics of control, CTE and AD brains was performed to characterize differentially expressed proteins, and we identified over 4000 proteins in CTE brains, including significant enrichment of the microtubule associated protein tau. We also found enrichment and pathologic aggregation of RNA processing factors as seen previously in AD, supporting the previously recognized overlap between AD and CTE. In addition to these similarities, we identified CTE-specific enrichment of proteins which increase with increasing severity of CTE pathology. NADPH dehydrogenase quinone 1 (NQO1) was one of the proteins which showed significant enrichment in CTE and also correlated with increasing CTE stage. NQO1 demonstrated neuropathologic correlation with hyperphosphorylated tau in glial cells, mainly astrocytes. These results demonstrate that quantitative proteomic analysis of CTE postmortem human brain can identify disease relevant findings and novel cellular pathways involved in CTE pathogenesis. "
2017-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often considered to be a risk factor for the later development of neurodegenerative conditions, but some findings do not support a link. Differences in research methods, clinical samples, and limitations encountered when assessing and documenting TBI details likely contribute to the mixed reports in the literature. Despite some variability in findings, a review of the literature does provide support for the notion that TBI appears to be associated with earlier onset of some neurodegenerative disorders, although clearly not everyone with a TBI appears to be at an increased risk. Whereas a mechanistic link remains unknown, TBI has been found to initiate an accumulation of pathological processes related to several neurodegenerative disorders. The authors propose a hypothetical model that relates TBI to the development of pathological burden overlapping with some neurodegenerative conditions, in which onset of cognitive/behavioral impairments is hastened in some individuals, but pathological processes stabilize afterward, resulting in a similar course of decline to individuals with dementia who do not have a history of TBI.

2018-01-01,"The acute and chronic effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been widely described; however, there is limited knowledge on how a TBI sustained during early adulthood or mid-adulthood will influence aging. Epidemiological studies have explored whether TBI poses a risk for dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases associated with aging. We will discuss the influence of TBI and resulting medical comorbidities such as endocrine, sleep, and inflammatory disturbances on age-related gray and white matter changes and cognitive decline. Post mortem studies examining amyloid, tau, and other proteins will be discussed within the context of neurodegenerative diseases and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The data support the suggestion that pathological changes triggered by an earlier TBI will have an influence on normal aging processes and will interact with neurodegenerative disease processes rather than the development of a specific disease, such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Chronic neurophysiologic change after TBI may have detrimental effects on neurodegenerative disease. "
2018-01-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may be a significant risk factor for development of neurodegenerative disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), and Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's (PD) diseases. Chronic TBI is associated with several pathological features that are also characteristic of neurodegenerative diseases, including tau pathologies, caspase-3-mediated apoptosis, neuroinflammation, and microvascular alterations. The goal of this study was to evaluate changes following TBI in cleaved-caspase-3 and caspase-3-cleaved tau truncated at Asp421, and their relationships to cellular markers potentially associated with inflammation and blood-brain (BBB) barrier damage. We studied astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), microglia (ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 [Iba1]), BBB (endothelial barrier antigen [EBA]), and activated microglia/macrophages (cluster of differentiation 68 [CD68]). We employed immunohistochemistry at different time points from 24 h to 3 months after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in rats, with particular interest in white matter. The study demonstrated that CCI caused chronic upregulation of cleaved-caspase-3 in the white matter of the corpus callosum. Increases in cleaved-caspase-3 in the corpus callosum were accompanied by accumulation of caspase-3-cleaved tau, with increasing perivascular aggregation 3 months after CCI. Immunofluorescence experiments further showed cellular co-localization of cleaved-caspase-3 with GFAP and CD68 and its adjacent localization with EBA, suggesting involvement of apoptosis and neuroinflammation in mechanisms of delayed BBB and microvascular damage that could contribute to white matter changes. This study also provides the first evidence that evolving upregulation of cleaved-caspase-3 is associated with accumulation of caspase-3-cleaved tau following experimental TBI, thus providing new insights into potential common mechanisms mediated by caspase-3 and underlying chronic TBI pathologies and neurodegenerative diseases.

2019-12-01,"Repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by Alzheimer-like changes in the brain. CTE has been defined through neuropathological findings among deceased athletes and others exposed to repetitive TBI, but to date there are no definitive clinical criteria for CTE. To evaluate the utility of currently proposed clinical criteria for CTE and suggest improvements. We describe two well-characterized patients referred for evaluation of CTE and apply the four major proposed criteria for CTE. These criteria were further assessed in a cohort of patients referred to a neurobehavior clinic with or without a history of TBI. Without a CTE biomarker, the current criteria were of limited utility when applied to the two patient and the Neurobehavior cohort. Six items were extracted as potentially improving the clinical diagnosis of CTE: length of exposure to head impacts, a progressive course, specific psychiatric symptoms, frontal-executive dysfunction, parkinsonism and tremors, and targeted findings on neuroimaging. The prevention and neurorehabilitation of CTE depends on clinical diagnosis, but, without a biomarker, the clinical diagnosis of CTE remains difficult. This report suggests that clinical criteria for CTE may be greatly improved with emphasis on several critical historical and clinical correlates of CTE. "
2018-01-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an increasingly important issue among veterans, athletes and the general public. Difficulties with sleep onset and maintenance are among the most commonly reported symptoms following injury, and sleep debt is associated with increased accumulation of beta amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in the interstitial space. Recent research into the glymphatic system, a lymphatic-like metabolic clearance mechanism in the central nervous system (CNS) which relies on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), interstitial fluid (ISF), and astrocytic processes, shows that clearance is potentiated during sleep. This system is damaged in the acute phase following mTBI, in part due to re-localization of aquaporin-4 channels away from astrocytic end feet, resulting in reduced potential for waste removal. Long-term consequences of chronic dysfunction within this system in the context of repetitive brain trauma and insomnia have not been established, but potentially provide one link in the explanatory chain connecting repetitive TBI with later neurodegeneration. Current research has shown p-tau deposition in perivascular spaces and along interstitial pathways in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), pathways related to glymphatic flow; these are the main channels by which metabolic waste is cleared. This review addresses possible links between mTBI-related damage to glymphatic functioning and physiological changes found in CTE, and proposes a model for the mediating role of sleep disruption in increasing the risk for developing CTE-related pathology and subsequent clinical symptoms following repetitive brain trauma.

2018-01-01,"Tau is the most common misfolded protein responsible for human neurodegenerative diseases. The identification of mutations in MAPT, the gene that encodes tau, causing dementia and parkinsonism established the notion that tau aggregation is responsible for the development of disease. An increased understanding of the pathway leading from conformational changes in tau protein and tau propagation to neuronal dysfunction, cell death and clinical manifestation will be the key for the development mechanism-based therapeutic strategies for tauopathies.

2017-12-01,"During the past decade, there has been an increasing interest in early diagnosis and treatment of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) that lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The subjects involved range from soldiers exposed to concussive injuries from improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to a significant number of athletes involved in repetitive high force impacts. Although the forces from IEDs are much greater by a magnitude than those from contact sports, the higher frequency associated with contact sports allows for more controlled assessment of the mechanism of action. In our study, we report findings in university-level women soccer athletes followed over a period of four and a half years from accession to graduation. Parameters investigated included T1-, T2-, and susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance images (SWI), IMPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing), and C3 Logix behavioral and physiological assessment measures. The MRI Studies show several significant findings: first, a marked increase in the width of sulci in the frontal to occipital cortices; second, an appearance of subtle hemorrhagic changes at the base of the sulci; third was a sustained reduction in total brain volume in several soccer players at a developmental time when brain growth is generally seen. Although all of the athletes successfully completed their college degree and none exhibited long term clinical deficits at the time of graduation, the changes documented by MRI represent a clue to the pathological mechanism following an injury paradigm. The authors propose that our findings and those of prior publications support a mechanism of injury in CTE caused by an autoimmune process associated with the release of neural proteins from nerve cells at the base of the sulcus from a water hammer injury effect. As evidence accumulates to support this hypothesis, there are pharmacological treatment strategies that may be able to mitigate the development of long-term disability from TBI. "

2017-12-01,"Misfolding of tau proteins into prions and their propagation along neural circuits are thought to result in neurodegeneration causing Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and other tauopathies. Little is known about the molecular processes mediating tau prion replication and spreading in different brain regions. Using transgenic (Tg) mice with a neuronal promoter driving expression of human mutant (P301S) tau, we found that tau prion formation and histopathologic deposition is largely restricted to the hindbrain. Unexpectedly, tau mRNA and protein levels did not differ between the forebrain and hindbrain, suggesting that other factors modulating the conversion of tau into a prion exist and are region specific. Using a cell-based prion propagation assay, we discovered that tau prion replication is suppressed by forebrain-derived inhibitors, one of which is sortilin, a lysosomal sorting receptor. We also show that sortilin expression is higher in the forebrain than the hindbrain across the life span of the Tg mice, suggesting that sortilin, at least in part, inhibits forebrain tau prion replication in vivo. Our findings provide evidence for selective vulnerability in mice resulting in highly regulated levels of tau prion propagation, thus affording a model for identification of additional molecules that could mitigate the levels of tau prions in human tauopathies.

2018-01-01,"Exposure to repetitive concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), has been linked with increased risk of long-term neurodegenerative changes, specifically chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). To date, preclinical studies largely have focused on the immediate aftermath of mTBI, with no literature on the lifelong consequences of mTBI in these models. This study provides the first account of lifelong neurobehavioral and histological consequences of repetitive mTBI providing unique insight into the constellation of evolving and ongoing pathologies with late survival. Male C57BL/6J mice (aged 2-3 months) were exposed to either single or repetitive mild TBI or sham procedure. Thereafter, animals were monitored and assessed at 24 months post last injury for measures of motor coordination, learning deficits, cognitive function, and anxiety-like behavior prior to euthanasia and preparation of the brains for detailed neuropathological and protein biochemical studies. At 24 months survival animals exposed to r-mTBI showed clear evidence of learning and working memory impairment with a lack of spatial memory and vestibule-motor vestibulomotor deficits compared to sham animals. Associated with these late behavioral deficits there was evidence of ongoing axonal degeneration and neuroinflammation in subcortical white matter tracts. Notably, these changes were also observed after a single mTBI, albeit to a lesser degree than repetitive mTBI. In this context, our current data demonstrate, for the first time, that rather than an acute, time limited event, mild TBI can precipitate a lifelong degenerative process. These data therefore suggest that successful treatment strategies should consider both the acute and chronic nature of mTBI. "
2017-12-01,"American football has both the highest rate of concussion incidences as well as the highest number of concussions of all contact sports due to both the number of athletes and nature of the sport. Recent research has linked concussions with long term health complications such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and early onset Alzheimer's. Understanding the mechanical characteristics of concussive impacts is critical to help protect athletes from these debilitating diseases and is now possible using helmet-based sensor systems. To date, real time on-field measurement of head impacts has been almost exclusively measured by devices that rely on accelerometers or gyroscopes attached to the player's helmet, or embedded in a mouth guard. These systems monitor motion of the head or helmet, but do not directly measure impact energy. This paper evaluates the accuracy of a novel, multifunctional foam-based sensor that replaces a portion of the helmet foam to measure impact. All modified helmets were tested using a National Operating Committee Standards for Athletic Equipment-style drop tower with a total of 24 drop tests (4 locations with 6 impact energies). The impacts were evaluated using a headform, instrumented with a tri-axial accelerometer, mounted to a Hybrid III neck assembly. The resultant accelerations were evaluated for both the peak acceleration and the severity indices. These data were then compared to the voltage response from multiple Nano Composite Foam sensors located throughout the helmet. The foam sensor system proved to be accurate in measuring both the HIC and Gadd severity index, as well as peak acceleration while also providing additional details that were previously difficult to obtain, such as impact energy.

2017-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder involving cognitive, motor, and psychiatrically-relevant symptoms resulting from repetitive head impacts. Psychiatric phenotypes of CTE, including depression and suicidality, present particular challenges for CTE research, given that the diagnosis requires postmortem neuropathological examination. The pathognomonic lesion of CTE is the perivascular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) protein at the depths of cortical sulci. These lesions are found in the earliest disease stages, and with advancing pathological severity, ptau deposition occurs in widespread brain regions in a four-stage scheme of severity. We review the psychiatric phenotypes of individuals neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE, and suggest that earlier CTE stages hold particular interest for psychiatric CTE research. In the early CTE stages, there is ptau pathology in frontal cortex and axonal loss in the frontal white matter, followed by progressive ptau neurofibrillary degeneration in the amygdala and hippocampus. Neuropathological changes in the frontal and medial temporal lobes may underlie psychiatric phenotypes. Additional insight into the association between CTE pathology and psychiatric sequelae may come from advancements in in vivo methods of CTE detection. Further epidemiological, clinical, and postmortem studies are needed to validate the nature of psychiatric sequelae in CTE. "
2017-11-01,"Later-life brain alterations in former tackle football players are poorly understood, particularly regarding their relationship with repetitive head impacts (RHIs) and clinical function. We examined white matter signal abnormalities (WMSAs) and their association with RHIs and clinical function in former National Football League (NFL) players. Eighty-six clinically symptomatic former NFL players and 23 same-age reportedly asymptomatic controls without head trauma exposure underwent magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing. FreeSurfer calculated WMSAs. A cumulative head impact index quantified RHIs. In former NFL players, increased volume of WMSAs was associated with higher cumulative head impact index scores ( In former NFL players, WMSAs may reflect long-term microvascular and nonmicrovascular pathologies from RHIs that negatively impact cognition.

2017-11-01,"As head injuries and their sequelae have become an increasingly salient matter of public health, experts in the field have made great progress elucidating the biological processes occurring within the brain at the moment of injury and throughout the recovery thereafter. Given the extraordinary rate at which our collective knowledge of neurotrauma has grown, new insights may be revealed by examining the existing literature across disciplines with a new perspective. This article will aim to expand the scope of this rapidly evolving field of research beyond the confines of the central nervous system (CNS). Specifically, we will examine the extent to which the bidirectional influence of the gut-brain axis modulates the complex biological processes occurring at the time of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and over the days, months, and years that follow. In addition to local enteric signals originating in the gut, it is well accepted that gastrointestinal (GI) physiology is highly regulated by innervation from the CNS. Conversely, emerging data suggests that the function and health of the CNS is modulated by the interaction between 1) neurotransmitters, immune signaling, hormones, and neuropeptides produced in the gut, 2) the composition of the gut microbiota, and 3) integrity of the intestinal wall serving as a barrier to the external environment. Specific to TBI, existing pre-clinical data indicates that head injuries can cause structural and functional damage to the GI tract, but research directly investigating the neuronal consequences of this intestinal damage is lacking. Despite this void, the proposed mechanisms emanating from a damaged gut are closely implicated in the inflammatory processes known to promote neuropathology in the brain following TBI, which suggests the gut-brain axis may be a therapeutic target to reduce the risk of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy and other neurodegenerative diseases following TBI. To better appreciate how various peripheral influences are implicated in the health of the CNS following TBI, this paper will also review the secondary biological injury mechanisms and the dynamic pathophysiological response to neurotrauma. Together, this review article will attempt to connect the dots to reveal novel insights into the bidirectional influence of the gut-brain axis and propose a conceptual model relevant to the recovery from TBI and subsequent risk for future neurological conditions.

2017-11-01,"Recent reports suggest that exposure to repetitive concussions in sports is associated with an increased risk of symptoms of distress, anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance or substance abuse/dependence (typically referred as symptoms of common mental disorders[CMD]) and of later development of neurodegenerative disease, in particular chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The primary aim of this study was to explore the relationship between sports career-related concussions and the subsequent occurrence of symptoms of CMD among former male professional athletes retired from football (soccer), ice hockey and rugby (union). Cross-sectional analyses were performed on baseline electronic questionnaires from three prospective cohort studies among former male professional athletes retired from football (soccer), ice hockey and rugby (union). The number of confirmed concussions was examined through a single question, while symptoms of distress, anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance and adverse alcohol use were assessed using validated questionnaires. From 1,957 former professional athletes contacted, a total of 576 (29%) completed the questionnaire. Of these, 23% had not incurred a concussion during their career, 34% had two or three, 18% four or five, and 11% six or more concussions. The number of sports career-related concussions was a predictor for all outcome measures (β = 0.072-0.109; P ≤ 0.040). Specifically, former professional athletes who reported a history of four or five concussions were approximately 1.5 times more likely to report symptoms of CMD, rising to a two- to five-fold increase in those reporting a history of six or more sports career-related concussions. These data demonstrate an association between exposure to sports concussion and subsequent risk of symptoms of CMD in former professional athletes across a range of contact sports. Further work to explore the association between sports concussion and symptoms of CMD is required; in the meanwhile, strategies for effective risk reduction and improved management appear indicated.

2017-11-01,"In recent years, a new neurodegenerative tauopathy labeled Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), has been identified that is believed to be primarily a sequela of repeated mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), often referred to as concussion, that occurs in athletes participating in contact sports (e.g. boxing, American football, Australian football, rugby, soccer, ice hockey) or in military combatants, especially after blast-induced injuries. Since the identification of CTE, and its neuropathological finding of deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau protein, mechanistic attention has been on lumping the disorder together with various other non-traumatic neurodegenerative tauopathies. Indeed, brains from suspected CTE cases that have come to autopsy have been confirmed to have deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau in locations that make its anatomical distribution distinct for other tauopathies. The fact that these individuals experienced repetitive TBI episodes during their athletic or military careers suggests that the secondary injury mechanisms that have been extensively characterized in acute TBI preclinical models, and in TBI patients, including glutamate excitotoxicity, intracellular calcium overload, mitochondrial dysfunction, free radical-induced oxidative damage and neuroinflammation, may contribute to the brain damage associated with CTE. Thus, the current review begins with an in depth analysis of what is known about the tau protein and its functions and dysfunctions followed by a discussion of the major TBI secondary injury mechanisms, and how the latter have been shown to contribute to tau pathology. The value of this review is that it might lead to improved neuroprotective strategies for either prophylactically attenuating the development of CTE or slowing its progression. "
2017-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repeated subconcussive and concussive head injury. Clinical features include cognitive, behavioral, mood, and motor impairments. Definitive diagnosis is only possible at postmortem. Here, the utility of neuroimaging in the diagnosis of CTE is evaluated by systematically reviewing recent evidence for changes in neuroimaging biomarkers in suspected cases of CTE compared with controls. Providing an update on a previous systematic review of articles published until December 2014, we searched for articles published between December 2014 and July 2016. We searched PubMed for studies assessing neuroimaging changes in symptomatic suspected cases of CTE with a history of repeated subconcussive or concussive head injury or participation in contact sports involving direct impact to the head. Exclusion criteria were case studies, review articles, and articles focusing on repetitive head trauma from military service, head banging, epilepsy, physical abuse, or animal models. Seven articles met the review criteria, almost all of which studied professional athletes. The range of modalities were categorized into structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI, and radionuclide studies. Biomarkers which differed significantly between suspected CTE and controls were Evans index (P = 0.05), cavum septum pellucidum (CSP) rate (P < 0.0006), length (P < 0.03) and ratio of CSP length to septum length (P < 0.03), regional differences in axial diffusivity (P < 0.05) and free/intracellular water fractions (P < 0.005), single-photon emission computed tomography perfusion abnormalities (P < 0.01), positron emission tomography (PET) signals from tau-binding, glucose-binding, and GABA receptor-binding radionuclides (P < 0.0001, P < 0.005, and P < 0.005, respectively). Important limitations include low specificity in identification of suspected cases of CTE across studies, the need for postmortem validation, and a lack of generalizability to nonprofessional athletes. The most promising biomarker is tau-binding radionuclide PET signal because it is most specific to the underlying neuropathology and differentiated CTE from both controls and patients with Alzheimer disease (P < 0.0001). Multimodal imaging will improve specificity further. Future research should minimize variability in identification of suspected cases of CTE using published clinical criteria. "

It is well-established that the clinical symptoms characteristic of tauopathies correlate with deficits in synaptic function and neuritic connectivity early in the course of disease, but mechanisms underlying these critical pathogenic events are not fully understood.

2017-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is characterized by acute neurological dysfunction and associated with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and Alzheimer's disease. We previously showed that cis phosphorylated tau (cis P-tau), but not the trans form, contributes to tau pathology and functional impairment in an animal model of severe TBI. Here we found that in human samples obtained post TBI due to a variety of causes, cis P-tau is induced in cortical axons and cerebrospinal fluid and positively correlates with axonal injury and clinical outcome. Using mouse models of severe or repetitive TBI, we showed that cis P-tau elimination with a specific neutralizing antibody administered immediately or at delayed time points after injury, attenuates the development of neuropathology and brain dysfunction during acute and chronic phases including CTE-like pathology and dysfunction after repetitive TBI. Thus, cis P-tau contributes to short-term and long-term sequelae after TBI, but is effectively neutralized by cis antibody treatment.Induction of the cis form of phosphorylated tau (cis P-tau) has previously been shown to occur in animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI), and blocking this form of tau using antibody was beneficial in a rodent model of severe TBI. Here the authors show that cis P-tau induction is a feature of several different forms of TBI in humans, and that administration of cis P-tau targeting antibody to rodents reduces or delays pathological features of TBI. "
2017-10-01,"Tauopathies constitute neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by the intracellular deposition of filaments made of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The pattern of tau deposition in Alzheimer's disease follows a stereotypical progression, with the first lesions appearing in the locus coeruleus and entorhinal cortex, from where they appear to spread to the hippocampus and neocortex. Propagation of pathological tau is also characteristic of argyrophilic grain disease, where the lesions seem to spread through distinct regions of the limbic system. In chronic traumatic encephalopathy, tauopathy appears to spread from the neocortex to the brainstem. These findings implicate neuron-to-neuron propagation of tau aggregates. Isoform compositions and morphologies of tau filaments can differ between tauopathies, which is consistent with the existence of distinct tau strains. Here, we review recent findings that support prion-like mechanisms in the pathogenesis of tauopathies through the experimental use of transgenic mice. "
2017-10-01,"Closed-head concussive injury is one of the most common causes of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Isolated concussions frequently produce acute neurological impairments, and individuals typically recover spontaneously within a short time frame. In contrast, brain injuries resulting from multiple concussions can result in cumulative damage and elevated risk of developing chronic brain pathologies. Increased attention has focused on identification of diagnostic markers that can prognostically serve as indices of brain health after injury, revealing the temporal profile of vulnerability to a second insult. Such markers may demarcate adequate recovery periods before concussed patients can return to required activities. We developed a noninvasive closed-head impact model that captures the hallmark symptoms of concussion in the absence of gross tissue damage. Animals were subjected to single or repeated concussive impact and examined using a battery of neurological, vestibular, sensorimotor, and molecular metrics. A single concussion induced transient, but marked, acute neurological impairment, gait alterations, neuronal death, and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expression in brain tissue. As expected, repeated concussions exacerbated sensorimotor dysfunction, prolonged gait abnormalities, induced neuroinflammation, and upregulated GFAP and tau. These animals also exhibited chronic functional neurological impairments with sustained astrogliosis and white matter thinning. Acute changes in molecular signatures correlated with behavioral impairments, whereas increased times to regaining consciousness and balance impairments were associated with higher GFAP and neuroinflammation. Overall, behavioral consequences of either single or repeated concussive impact injuries appeared to resolve more quickly than the underlying molecular, metabolic, and neuropathological abnormalities. This observation, which is supported by similar studies in other mTBI models, underscores the critical need to develop more objective prognostic measures for guiding return-to-play decisions. "
2017-10-01,"Scientific and lay interest in negative outcomes associated with exposure to repetitive brain trauma (RBT) continues to strengthen. Concerns about the association between RBT and dementia began more than a century ago, but have resurfaced in the last decade with the more recently described chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a tauopathy associated with RBT that has become inextricably linked to conversations about sport-related concussion and mild traumatic brain injury. Accordingly, specific populations such as collision sport athletes and certain military personnel are of particular interest owing to their unique exposure to RBT. The gaps and controversies in our understanding of the epidemiologic factors, mechanism, and clinicopathological correlates of CTE reflect the current reliance on postmortem case series investigations. This review discusses the state of the science of CTE and raises considerations for researching and interpreting cognitive changes in members of at-risk populations. The recent development of pathological diagnostic criteria for CTE represented an important step for differentiating CTE from other neurodegenerative diseases. By comparison, defining the clinical syndrome(s) associated with CTE and the necessary and sufficient symptoms needed for its diagnosis lags behind. The absence of validated in vivo biomarkers of pathological characteristics of CTE and longitudinal tracking with neuropsychological evaluation remains a significant hurdle. Attribution of candidate symptoms in retired athletes to CTE is complicated by the presence of multiple premorbid and comorbid factors affecting cognitive reserve that influence normal or expected cognitive functioning. This is a critical issue in appropriately defining reference groups for normative comparisons. Available data, while limited and complicated by selection bias, indicate that exposure to RBT represents the greatest risk factor for CTE pathological features, although clinicopathological correlates and the nature of onset and progression of symptoms are largely unknown. Considering aspects of cognitive reserve is likely essential for both interpreting cognitive outcomes associated with CTE and for developing preventive treatment programs. Research on CTE would benefit greatly from incorporating principles established within other areas of neurodegenerative disease and the nuances of clinicopathological considerations. "
2017-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can have lifelong and dynamic effects on health and wellbeing. Research on the long-term consequences emphasises that, for many patients, TBI should be conceptualised as a chronic health condition. Evidence suggests that functional outcomes after TBI can show improvement or deterioration up to two decades after injury, and rates of all-cause mortality remain elevated for many years. Furthermore, TBI represents a risk factor for a variety of neurological illnesses, including epilepsy, stroke, and neurodegenerative disease. With respect to neurodegeneration after TBI, post-mortem studies on the long-term neuropathology after injury have identified complex persisting and evolving abnormalities best described as polypathology, which includes chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Despite growing awareness of the lifelong consequences of TBI, substantial gaps in research exist. Improvements are therefore needed in understanding chronic pathologies and their implications for survivors of TBI, which could inform long-term health management in this sizeable patient population.

2017-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a long-term neurodegenerative consequence of repetitive head impacts which can only be definitively diagnosed in post-mortem. Recently, the consensus neuropathological criteria for the diagnosis of CTE was published requiring the presence of the accumulation of abnormal tau in neurons and astroglia distributed around small blood vessels at the depths of cortical sulci in an irregular pattern as the mandatory features. The clinical diagnosis and antemortem prediction of CTE pathology remain challenging if not impossible due to the common co-existing underlying neurodegenerative pathologies and the lack of specific clinical pointers and reliable biomarkers. This review summarizes the historical evolution of CTE as a neuropathological entity and highlights the latest advances and future directions of research studies on the topic of CTE. "
2017-10-01,"Little is known of the long-term effects of sports-related concussion. Within the scientific literature, conclusions vary substantially where some work suggests there are no long-term consequences at all and other studies show rampant neurodegeneration thought to be caused by sometimes even a single concussive blow to the head. There is growing evidence that supports multiple long-term outcomes, showing both subclinical and clinically relevant changes in the brains of athletes, young and old alike. This article reviews the pathohistology of cerebral concussions and examines the extant literature with a focus on electrophysiological and neuroimaging findings. Neurobehavioral and neurocognitive changes are also reviewed, particularly as they are related to chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Lacunae within the literature are explored, and future research directions are proposed. "

2017-09-01,"CCL11, a protein previously associated with age-associated cognitive decline, is observed to be increased in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) compared to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a cohort of 23 deceased American football players with neuropathologically verified CTE, 50 subjects with neuropathologically diagnosed AD, and 18 non-athlete controls, CCL11 was measured with ELISA in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLFC) and CSF. CCL11 levels were significantly increased in the DLFC in subjects with CTE (fold change = 1.234, p < 0.050) compared to non-athlete controls and AD subjects with out a history of head trauma. This increase was also seen to correlate with years of exposure to American football (β = 0.426, p = 0.048) independent of age (β = -0.046, p = 0.824). Preliminary analyses of a subset of subjects with available post-mortem CSF showed a trend for increased CCL11 among individuals with CTE (p = 0.069) mirroring the increase in the DLFC. Furthermore, an association between CSF CCL11 levels and the number of years exposed to football (β = 0.685, p = 0.040) was observed independent of age (β = -0.103, p = 0.716). Finally, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated CSF CCL11 accurately distinguished CTE subjects from non-athlete controls and AD subjects (AUC = 0.839, 95% CI 0.62-1.058, p = 0.028). Overall, the current findings provide preliminary evidence that CCL11 may be a novel target for future CTE biomarker studies. "
2017-09-01,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive dysfunction and loss of neurons associated with depositions of pathologically altered proteins showing hierarchical involvement of brain regions. The role of astrocytes in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases is explored as contributors to neuronal degeneration or neuroprotection pathways, and also as potential mediators of the transcellular spreading of disease-associated proteins. Protein astrogliopathy (PAG), including deposition of amyloid-β, prion protein, tau, α-synuclein, and very rarely transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) is not unprecedented or unusual in neurodegenerative diseases. Morphological characterization of PAG is considered, however, only for the neuropathological diagnosis and classification of tauopathies. Astrocytic tau pathology is seen in primary frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) associated with tau pathologies (FTLD-Tau), and also in the form of aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG). Importantly, ARTAG shares common features with primary FTLD-Tau as well as with the astroglial tau pathologies that are thought to be hallmarks of a brain injury-related tauopathy known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Supported by experimental observations, the morphological variability of PAG might reflect distinct pathogenic involvement of different astrocytic populations. PAG might indicate astrocytic contribution to spreading or clearance of disease-associated proteins, however, this might lead to astrocytic dysfunction and eventually contribute to the degeneration of neurons. Here, we review recent advances in understanding ARTAG and other related forms of PAG. "

2017-09-01,"Blast-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a signature injury of recent military conflicts, leading to increased Department of Defense (DoD) interest in its potential long-term effects, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The DoD Blast Injury Research Program Coordinating Office convened the 2015 International State-of-the-Science Meeting to discuss the existing evidence regarding a causal relationship between TBI and CTE. Over the course of the meeting, experts across government, academia, and the sports community presented cutting edge research on the unique pathological characteristics of blast-related TBI, blast-related neurodegenerative mechanisms, risk factors for CTE, potential biomarkers for CTE, and treatment strategies for chronic neurodegeneration. The current paper summarizes these presentations. Although many advances have been made to address these topics, more research is needed to establish the existence of links between the long-term effects of single or multiple blast-related TBI and CTE.

2017-09-01,"The United States Department of Defense Blast Injury Research Program Coordinating Office organized the 2015 International State-of-the-Science meeting to explore links between blast-related head injury and the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Before the meeting, the planning committee examined articles published between 2005 and October 2015 and prepared this literature review, which summarized broadly CTE research and addressed questions about the pathophysiological basis of CTE and its relationship to blast- and nonblast-related head injury. It served to inform participants objectively and help focus meeting discussion on identifying knowledge gaps and priority research areas. CTE is described generally as a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting persons exposed to head injury. Affected individuals have been participants primarily in contact sports and military personnel, some of whom were exposed to blast. The symptomatology of CTE overlaps with Alzheimer's disease and includes neurological and cognitive deficits, psychiatric and behavioral problems, and dementia. There are no validated diagnostic criteria, and neuropathological evidence of CTE has come exclusively from autopsy examination of subjects with histories of exposure to head injury. The perivascular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) at the depths of cortical sulci is thought to be unique to CTE and has been proposed as a diagnostic requirement, although the contribution of p-tau and other reported pathologies to the development of clinical symptoms of CTE are unknown. The literature on CTE is limited and is focused predominantly on head injuries unrelated to blast exposure (e.g., football players and boxers). In addition, comparative analyses of clinical case reports has been challenging because of small case numbers, selection biases, methodological differences, and lack of matched controls, particularly for blast-exposed individuals. Consequently, the existing literature is not sufficient to determine whether the development of CTE is associated with head injury frequency (e.g., single vs. multiple exposures) or head injury type (e.g., impact, nonimpact, blast-related). Moreover, the incidence and prevalence of CTE in at-risk populations is unknown. Future research priorities should include identifying additional risk factors, pursuing population-based longitudinal studies, and developing the ability to detect and diagnose CTE in living persons using validated criteria.

2017-09-01,"Repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) caused by playing collision sports or by exposure to blasts during military operations can lead to late onset, chronic diseases such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative condition that manifests in increasingly severe neuropsychiatric abnormalities years after the last injury. Currently, because of the heterogeneity of the clinical presentation, confirmation of a CTE diagnosis requires post-mortem examination of the brain. The hallmarks of CTE are abnormal accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein, TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions, and astroglial abnormalities, but the pathomechanism leading to these terminal findings remains unknown. Animal modeling can play an important role in the identification of CTE pathomechanisms, the development of early stage diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers, and pharmacological interventions. Modeling the long-term consequences of blast rmTBI in animals is especially challenging because of the complexities of blast physics and animal-to-human scaling issues. This review summarizes current knowledge about the pathobiologies of CTE and rmbTBI and discusses problems as well as potential solutions related to high-fidelity modeling of rmbTBI and determining its long-term consequences. "
2017-09-01,"Blast traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has been shown to contribute to progressive neurodegenerative disease. Recent evidence suggests that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a mechanistic link between acute neurotrauma and progressive tauopathy. We propose that ER stress contributes to extensive behavioral changes associated with a chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)-like phenotype. Targeting ER stress is a promising option for the treatment of neurotrauma-related neurodegeneration, which warrants investigation. Utilizing our validated and clinically relevant Sprague-Dawley blast model, we investigated a time course of mechanistic changes that occur following bTBI (50 psi) including: ER stress activation, iron-mediated toxicity, and tauopathy via Western blot and immunohistochemistry. These changes were associated with behavioral alterations measured by the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM), Forced Swim Test (FST), and Morris Water Maze (MWM). Following characterization, salubrinal, an ER stress modulator, was given at a concentration of 1 mg/kg post-blast, and its mechanism of action was determined in vitro. bTBI significantly increased markers of injury in the cortex of the left hemisphere: p-PERK and p-eIF2α at 30 min, p-T205 tau at 6 h, and iron at 24 h. bTBI animals spent more time immobile on the FST at 72 h and more time in the open arm of the EPM at 7 days. Further, bTBI caused a significant learning disruption measured with MWM at 21 days post-blast, with persistent tau changes. Salubrinal successfully reduced ER stress markers in vivo and in vitro while significantly improving performance on the EPM. bTBI causes robust biochemical changes that contribute to neurodegeneration, but these changes may be targeted with ER stress modulators.

2017-09-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is strongly linked to an increased risk of developing dementia, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy and possibly Alzheimer's disease (AD). APOEε4 allele of human Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major genetic risk factor for late onset AD and has been associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy and unfavorable outcome following TBI. To determine if there is an APOE isoform-specific response to TBI we performed controlled cortical impact on 3-month-old mice expressing human APOE3 or APOE4 isoforms. Following injury, we used several behavior paradigms to test for anxiety and learning and found that APOE3 and APOE4 targeted replacement mice demonstrate cognitive impairments following moderate TBI. Transcriptional profiling 14days following injury revealed a significant effect of TBI, which was similar in both genotypes. Significantly upregulated by injury in both genotypes were mRNA expression and protein level of ABCA1 transporter and APOJ, but not APOE. To identify gene-networks correlated to injury and APOE isoform, we performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis. We determined that the network mostly correlated to TBI in animals expressing both isoforms is immune response with major hub genes including Trem2, Tyrobp, Clec7a and Cd68. We also found a significant increase of TREM2, IBA-1 and GFAP protein levels in the brains of injured mice. We identified a network representing myelination that correlated significantly with APOE isoform in both injury groups. This network was significantly enriched in oligodendrocyte signature genes, such as Mbp and Plp1. Our results demonstrate unique and distinct gene networks at this acute time point for injury and APOE isoform, as well as a network driven by APOE isoform across TBI groups. "
2017-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that presents as a late sequela from traumatic brain injury (TBI). TBI is a growing and under-recognized public health concern with a high degree of morbidity and large associated global costs. While the immune response to TBI is complex, its contribution to the development of CTE remains largely unknown. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the link between CTE and the resident innate immune system of the brain-microglia. We discuss the neuropathology underlying CTE including the creation and aggregation of phosphorylated tau protein into neurofibrillary tangles and the formation of amyloid beta deposits. We also present how microglia, the resident innate immune cells of the brain, drive the continuous low-level inflammation associated with the insidious onset of CTE. In this review, we conclude that the latency period between the index brain injury and the long-term development of CTE presents an opportunity for therapeutic intervention. Encouraging advances with microtubule stabilizers, cis p-tau antibodies, and the ability to therapeutically alter the inflammatory state of microglia have shown positive results in both animal and human trials. Looking forward, recent advancements in next-generation sequencing technology for the study of genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic information will provide an opportunity for significant advancement in our understanding of prorepair and pro-injury gene signatures allowing for targeted intervention in this highly morbid injury process.

2017-08-01,"Background Concussions, a form of mild traumatic brain injury, are a current ""hot topic"" in sports and medicine, with current research focusing on diagnosis, treatment, and the long-term effects of repeated concussions on development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Concussions represent 8.9% of all high school athletic injuries, and pediatricians see many of these patients in their practices, however evolving guidelines and recommendations have resulted in varying practices among providers. Objective To assess how local pediatricians in New York Chapter 2 of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) diagnose and treat concussion patients, and to evaluate the need for continuing education in this area. Design and methods Survey Monkey™ was used to query providers regarding their diagnosis and treatment of concussion patients. A total of three emails containing a link to the 22 question multiple-choice survey were sent to AAP Chapter 2 members between January 2015 and June 2015. The survey was adapted and modified with permission from one previously used by ""Zonfrillo MR, Master CL, Grady MF, Winston FK, Callahan JM, Arbogast KB. Pediatric providers' self-reported knowledge, practices, and attitudes about concussion. Pediatrics. 2012;130:1120-5"". Results We received 115 responses from 1436 potential participants to whom the survey link was sent, resulting in an 8% response rate. We excluded subspecialists from our data analysis, resulting in data from 95 primary care pediatricians. Of the PCPs 98.7% reported seeing at least one child or adolescent with a concussion in the previous 12 months and 76.6% reported referring some or all of their concussion patients for ongoing management. The most common reason for referral was ""I am not always comfortable with management"" and the most common subspecialist referral was to a neurologist. Most providers reported that they did not use any guidelines for management (58.3%) and only 57.4% were familiar with the New York State Education Department concussion guidelines. Almost half reported inadequate training in performing neurocognitive assessments (48.6%). Most were comfortable educating families about the diagnosis of concussion (81.7%), as well as recommending the appropriate time to resume school (70.4%) and prescribing and monitoring a return to play protocol (62%). A total of 84.3% also responded, however, that they would be interested in a webinar for a continuing medical education(CME) credit focused on concussion diagnosis and management. Conclusions Most pediatric providers care for patients who have suffered a concussion, however many identify barriers to diagnosis and treatment, which results in patients being referred to subspecialists for further management. Many providers are also unfamiliar with, or do not use, published concussion guidelines and report varying practices in treatment of concussion patients due to evolving recommendations. This study demonstrates that there is a need for further education for pediatric providers who see patients with concussion. "

2017-08-01,"This review provides an in-depth overview of diagnostic schema and risk factors influencing recovery during the acute, subacute (operationally defined as up to 3 months postinjury), and chronic injury phases across the full spectrum of individuals (e.g., athletes to neurosurgery patients) with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Particular emphasis is placed on the complex differential diagnoses for patients with prolonged postconcussive symptoms. Select literature review and synthesis. In spite of an increase in public awareness surrounding the acute and potential long-term effects of mTBI, the medical field remains fragmented both in terms of the diagnostic (different criteria proffered by multiple medical organizations) and prognostic factors that influence patient care. Given the lack of objective biomarkers and the spectrum of different disorders that likely encompass mTBI, clinicians are encouraged to adopt a probabilistic, rather than definitive, diagnostic and prognostic framework. The relevance of accurately diagnosing and managing the different manifestations of mTBI becomes clear when one considers the overall incidence of the disorder (42 million people each year worldwide), and the different treatment implications for patients with a true neurodegenerative disorder (e.g., chronic traumatic encephalopathy; rare) vs potentially treatable conditions (e.g., depression or posttraumatic headache; frequent).

2017-08-01,"Concussion has been recognized as a clinical entity for more than 1000 years. Throughout the 20th century it was studied extensively in boxers, but it did not pique the interest of the general population because it is the accepted goal of the boxer to inflict such an injury on their opponent. In 2002, however, the possibility that repetitive concussions could result in chronic brain damage and a progressive neurologic disorder was raised by a postmortem evaluation of a retired player in the most popular sports institution in the United States, the National Football League. Since that time concussion has been a frequent topic of conversation in homes, schools, and on television and has become a major focus of sports programs in communities and schools at all levels. Now all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association have enacted laws and rules to protect the athlete. "
2017-08-01,"A history of repeated concussion has been linked to the later development of neurodegeneration, which is associated with the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and the development of behavioral deficits. However, the role that exogenous factors, such as immune activation, may play in the development of neurodegeneration following repeated mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI) has not yet been explored. To investigate, male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered three mTBIs 5days apart using the diffuse impact-acceleration model to generate ∼100G. Sham animals underwent surgery only. At 1 or 5days following the last injury rats were given the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.1mg/kg), or saline. TLR4 activation had differential effects following rmTBI depending on the timing of activation. When given at 1day post-injury, LPS acutely activated microglia, but decreased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6. This was associated with a reduction in neuronal injury, both acutely, with a restoration of levels of myelin basic protein (MBP), and chronically, preventing a loss of both MBP and PSD-95. Furthermore, these animals did not develop behavioral deficits with no changes in locomotion, anxiety, depressive-like behavior or cognition at 3months post-injury. Conversely, when LPS was given at 5days post-injury, it was associated acutely with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine production, with an exacerbation of neuronal damage and increased levels of aggregated and phosphorylated tau. At 3months post-injury, there was a slight exacerbation of functional deficits, particularly in cognition and depressive-like behavior. This highlights the complexity of the immune response following rmTBI and the need to understand how a history of rmTBI interacts with environmental factors to influence the potential to develop later neurodegeneration.

Neuropathological severity of CTE was distributed across the highest level of play, with all 3 former high school players having mild pathology and the majority of former college (27 [56%]), semiprofessional (5 [56%]), and professional (101 [86%]) players having severe pathology. Among 27 participants with mild CTE pathology, 26 (96%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 23 (85%) had cognitive symptoms, and 9 (33%) had signs of dementia. Among 84 participants with severe CTE pathology, 75 (89%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 80 (95%) had cognitive symptoms, and 71 (85%) had signs of dementia. In a convenience sample of deceased football players who donated their brains for research, a high proportion had neuropathological evidence of CTE, suggesting that CTE may be related to prior participation in football.

2017-07-01,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is an established neurodegenerative disease that is closely associated with exposure to repetitive mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). The mechanisms responsible for its complex pathological changes remain largely elusive, despite a recent consensus to define the neuropathological criteria. Here, we describe a novel method to develop a model of CTE in Drosophila melanogaster (Drosophila ) in an attempt to identify the key genes and pathways that lead to the characteristic hyperphosphorylated tau accumulation and neuronal death in the brain. Adjustable-strength impacts to inflict mild closed injury are delivered directly to the fly head, subjecting the head to rapid acceleration and deceleration. Our method eliminates the potential problems inherent with other Drosophila mTBI models (e.g.,animal death might be induced by damage to other parts of the body or to internal organs). The less labor- and cost-intensive animal care, short life span, and extensive genetic tools make the fruit fly ideal to study CTE pathogenesis and make it possible to perform large-scale, genome-wide forward genetic and pharmacological screens. We anticipate that the ongoing characterization of the model will generate important mechanistic insights on disease prevention and therapeutic approaches. "
2017-07-01,"As participation in youth sports has risen over the past two decades, so has the incidence of youth sports injuries. A common topic of concern is concussion, or mild traumatic brain injury, in young athletes and whether concussions sustained at a young age could lead to lifelong impairment such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). While the pathway from a concussed young athlete to an adult with CTE remains unknown, current research is attempting to provide more clarity. This article discusses how health care professionals can help foster an informed, balanced decision-making process regarding participation in contact sports that involves the parents as well as the children.

2019-11-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was initially described in boxers, but in recent years it has been reported in other settings, particularly in contact sports and military personnel. Soccer (football association) had previously been (and still is) considered relatively safe when compared to other sports, such as American football. However, a few cases of professional soccer players with CTE have been reported in the last few years. It is still unknown how frequent this condition is in soccer players, and the role played by heading the ball remains elusive. Other traumas to the head, face and neck caused by contact with another player's head, arm or other body parts are among the most frequent in soccer. In spite of the lack of more in-depth knowledge, there is reasonable evidence for recommending severe punishment (red card and suspension for several matches) for players causing avoidable trauma to another player's head. Encefalopatia traumática crônica (ETC) foi inicialmente descrita em boxeadores, mas nos últimos anos tem sido relatada em outras situações, particularmente nos esportes de contato e no pessoal militar. O futebol ou futebol de associação foi (e ainda é) considerado relativamente mais seguro quando comparado a outros esportes, como o futebol americano. No entanto, alguns casos de jogadores de futebol profissional com CTE foram relatados nos últimos anos. Ainda não se sabe a frequência dessa condição nos jogadores de futebol bem como qual o papel desempenhado por cabecear a bola. Outros traumas de crânio e pescoço causados pelo contato com o crânio, braço ou outras partes do corpo de outros jogadores estão entre os mais frequentes no futebol. Apesar da falta de um conhecimento mais aprofundado, há razoável evidência para recomendar punição severa (cartão vermelho e suspensão por várias partidas) para jogadores que causarem trauma evitável na cabeça de outro jogador.

2017-07-01,"This review aims to integrate current literature on the pathogenic mechanisms of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) to create a multifactorial understanding of the disease. CTE is a progressive neurodegenerative disease, classed as a tauopathy, although it appears the pathogenic mechanisms are more complex than this. It affects those with a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. Currently, there are no treatments for CTE and the disease can only be affirmatively diagnosed in post mortem. Understanding the pathogenesis of the disease will provide an avenue to explore possible treatment and diagnostic modalities. The pathological hallmarks of CTE have been well characterised and have been linked to the pathophysiologic mechanisms in this review. Human studies are limited due to ethical implications of exposing subjects to head trauma. Phosphorylation of tau, microglial activation, TAR DNA-binding protein 43 and diffuse axonal injury have all been implicated in the pathogenesis of CTE. The neuronal loss and axonal dysfunction mediated by these pathognomonic mechanisms lead to the broad psycho-cognitive symptoms seen in CTE. "
2017-07-01,"Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), previously believed to be a common cause of atypical parkinsonism, is now recognised as a range of motor and behavioural syndromes that are associated with a characteristic 4-repeat tau neuropathology. New research criteria that recognise early presentations of PSP and operationalise diagnosis of the full spectrum of clinical phenotypes have been reported. The Movement Disorders Society PSP diagnostic criteria include syndromes with few or mild symptoms that are suggestive of underlying PSP pathology and could provide an opportunity for earlier therapeutic interventions in the future. These criteria also include definitions for variant PSP syndromes with different patterns of movement, language, or behavioural features than have been conclusively associated with PSP pathology. Data from new diagnostic biomarkers can be combined with the clinical features of disease to increase the specificity of the new criteria for underlying PSP pathology. Because PSP is associated with tau protein abnormalities, there is growing interest in clinical trials of new tau-directed therapies. These therapies are hypothesised to have disease-modifying effects by reducing the concentration of toxic forms of tau in the brain or by compensating for loss of tau function. Since tau pathology is also central to Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a successful tau therapeutic for PSP might inform treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases. "
2017-06-01,"Hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of the neuronal protein tau are responsible for neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies. Dysregulation of the alternative splicing of tau exon 10 results in alterations of the ratio of two tau isoforms, 3R-tau and 4R-tau, which have been seen in several tauopathies. Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) is involved in the regulation of RNA processing, including splicing. Cytoplasmic aggregation of TDP-43 has been observed in the brains of individuals with chronic traumatic encephalopathy or Alzheimer's disease, diseases in which neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau are hallmarks. Here, we investigated the role of TDP-43 in tau exon 10 splicing. We found that TDP-43 promoted tau exon 10 inclusion, which increased production of the 4R-tau isoform. Moreover, TDP-43 could bind to intron 9 of tau pre-mRNA. Deletion of the TDP-43 N or C terminus promoted its cytoplasmic aggregation and abolished or diminished TDP-43-promoted tau exon 10 inclusion. Several TDP-43 mutations associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions promoted tau exon 10 inclusion more effectively than wild-type TDP-43 but did not affect TDP-43 cytoplasmic aggregation in cultured cells. The ratio of 3R-tau/4R-tau was decreased in transgenic mouse brains expressing human TDP-43 and increased in the brains expressing the disease-causing mutation TDP-43 "

2017-06-01,"In the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, tau pathology is accompanied usually by intracellular aggregation of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). However, the role of TDP-43 in tau pathogenesis is not understood. Here, we investigated the role of TDP-43 in tau expression in vitro and in vivo. We found that TDP-43 suppressed tau expression by promoting its mRNA instability through the UG repeats of its 3΄-untranslated region (3΄-UTR). The C-terminal region of TDP-43 was required for this function. Neurodegenerative diseases-causing TDP-43 mutations affected tau mRNA instability differentially, in that some promoted and others did not significantly affect tau mRNA instability. The expression levels of tau and TDP-43 were inverse in the frontal cortex and the cerebellum. Accompanied with cytoplasmic accumulation of TDP-43, tau expression was elevated in TDP-43M337V transgenic mouse brains. The level of TDP-43, which is decreased in AD brains, was found to correlate negatively with the tau level in human brain. Our findings indicate that TDP-43 suppresses tau expression by promoting the instability of its mRNA. Down-regulation of TDP-43 may be involved in the tau pathology in AD and related neurodegenerative disorders. "
2017-06-01,"Pathological changes to the tau protein, including conformational changes and aggregation, are major hallmarks of a group of neurodegenerative disorders known as tauopathies. Among the conformational changes are alterations involving the extreme amino terminus of the protein, known as the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). Aberrant PAD exposure induces a signaling cascade that leads to disruption of axonal transport, a critical function for neuronal survival. Conformational display of PAD is an early marker of pathological tau in Alzheimer disease (AD), but its role in other tauopathies has yet to be firmly established. We used a relatively novel N-terminal, conformation-sensitive antibody, TNT2, to determine whether misfolding in the amino terminus (ie, PAD exposure) occurs in non-AD tauopathies. We found that TNT2 specifically labeled pathological tau in post-mortem human brain tissue from Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but did not label nonpathological, parenchymal tau. Tau13, another N-terminal antibody, was not sensitive to pathological N-terminal conformations. Tau13 did not readily distinguish between normal (ie, parenchymal tau) and pathological tau species and showed a range of effectiveness at identifying tau pathologies in the non-AD tauopathies. These findings demonstrate that the conformational display of the PAD in tau represents a common pathological event in many tauopathies. "
2017-06-01,"Systematic review of possible long-term effects of sports-related concussion in retired athletes. Ten electronic databases. Original research; incidence, risk factors or causation related to long-term mental health or neurological problems; individuals who have suffered a concussion; retired athletes as the subjects and possible long-term sequelae defined as  Study population, exposure/outcome measures, clinical data, neurological examination findings, cognitive assessment, neuroimaging findings and neuropathology results. Risk of bias and level of evidence were evaluated by two authors. Following review of 3819 studies, 47 met inclusion criteria. Some former athletes have depression and cognitive deficits later in life, and there is an association between these deficits and multiple prior concussions. Former athletes are not at increased risk for death by suicide (two studies). Former high school American football players do not appear to be at increased risk for later life neurodegenerative diseases (two studies). Some retired professional American football players may be at increased risk for diminishment in cognitive functioning or mild cognitive impairment (several studies), and neurodegenerative diseases (one study). Neuroimaging studies show modest evidence of macrostructural, microstructural, functional and neurochemical changes in some athletes. Multiple concussions appear to be a risk factor for cognitive impairment and mental health problems in some individuals. More research is needed to better understand the prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other neurological conditions and diseases, and the extent to which they are related to concussions and/or repetitive neurotrauma sustained in sports.

2017-06-01,Reductions in spoken language complexity have been associated with the onset of various neurological disorders. The objective of this study is to analyze whether similar trends are found in professional football players who are at risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We compare changes in linguistic complexity (as indexed by the type-to-token ratio and lexical density) measured from the interview transcripts of players in the National Football League (NFL) to those measured from interview transcripts of coaches and/or front-office NFL executives who have never played professional football. A multilevel mixed model analysis reveals that exposure to the high-impact sport (vs no exposure) was associated with an overall decline in language complexity scores over time. This trend persists even after controlling for age as a potential confound. The results set the stage for a prospective study to test the hypothesis that language complexity decline is a harbinger of chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

Family medicine residents (N = 348). To describe relationships between awareness of concussion management and lifestyle, education background, and residency placement,  The residents who responded (n = 73, response rate 21%) correctly answered an average of 5.2 questions out of 9 (58%) regarding the diagnosis and management of concussion. Postgraduate year, sex, personal history of concussion, and clinical exposure to concussion were not significant factors in predicting the number of correct answers. Several misconceptions and knowledge gaps were revealed. Of residents who responded, 71% did not recognize chronic traumatic encephalopathy and only 63% recognized second-impact syndrome as consequences of repetitive concussions. Moreover, 32% of residents did not think that every individual with a concussion should see a physician as part of management. Knowledge scores did not predict self-reported concussion knowledge. Thematic analysis revealed 4 themes related to the challenges of concussion diagnosis and management: the nonspecificity and vagueness of symptoms, lack of formal diagnostic criteria, patient compliance with management, and counseling patients with respect to return to play, work, or learning. We found substantial gaps in knowledge surrounding concussion diagnosis and management among family medicine residents. This lack of knowledge should be addressed at both the undergraduate medical education level and the residency training level to improve concussion-related care and patient outcomes. "
2017-06-01,"Here we present an autopsy case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a 36-year-old man. He had a history of febrile seizures at the age of four and was severely demented at age 10 when he was admitted to a mental hospital. He had suffered repetitive self-harm, such as frequent banging of the head on the wall in his hospital record, but he had no clear history between the ages of four and ten. Autopsy revealed global cerebral atrophy, including the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, mammilary bodies and lateral geniculate bodies. This case showed typical pathological features of CTE. Phosphorylated tau (p-tau)-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and neuropil threads (NT) we are widely distributed in the brain, especially in the depth of the cerebral sulci. NFT and NT were also found in the basal ganglia, thalamus, amygdala and brainstem. Scanty β-amyloid deposits were found in the motor and sensory cortices, but α-synuclein was completely negative in the brain. This example showed that CTE can occur in young ages and that even children can experience CTE dementia. "
2017-06-01,"Since its discovery as a major CNS-abundant protein 25 years ago, Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1) has emerged as an important enzyme in regulating brain protein metabolism, by coupling to the proteasome pathway of protein degradation. Areas covered: UCH-L1 is implicated in both familial and sporadic Parkinson disease and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Also, UCH-L1 has been recently emerging as a biofluid-based biomarker for various forms of acute neurotrauma and CNS injury. Expert opinion: The loss of UCH-L1 activity coupled with the gain of proteinopathy function are linked to neurodegeneration such as Parkinsonism and Alzheimer's disease. In addition, certain post-translational modifications of UCH-L1 might promote the conversion of the cytosolic UCH-L1(C) to the membrane-associated UCH-L1(M) form, which seems to play a role in alpha-synucleinopathy formation. Thus, targeting the conversion of UCH-L1(C) to the UCH-L1(M) form might be the key to developing therapies for neurodegenerative diseases linked to UCH-L1. In parallel, UCH-L1 is also emerging as a promising neuron-derived biomarker for traumatic brain injury, ischemic and homographic stroke, pediatric hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, spinal cord injury, epileptic seizure and cardiac arrest. This shows that UCH-L1 has strong potential as a robust and universal biomarker target for various forms of CNS injury. "

2017-06-01,"There is continuing concern about effects of concussion in athletes, including risk of the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, information on long-term health and wellbeing in former athletes is limited. Outcome after exposure to repeated brain injury was investigated in 52 retired male Scottish international rugby players (RIRP) and 29 male controls who were similar in age and social deprivation. Assessment included history of playing rugby and traumatic brain injury, general and mental health, life stress, concussion symptoms, cognitive function, disability and markers of chronic stress (allostatic load). The estimated number of concussions in RIRP averaged 14 (median=7; IQR 5-40). Performance was poorer in RIRP than controls on a test of verbal learning (p=0.022) and of fine co-ordination of the dominant hand (p=0.038) and not significantly different on other cognitive tests (p>0.05). There were no significant associations between number of concussions and performance on cognitive tests. Other than a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease in controls, no group differences were detected in general or mental health or estimates of allostatic load. In RIRP, persisting symptoms attributed to concussion were more common if reporting more than nine concussions (p=0.028), although these symptoms were not perceived to affect social or work functioning. Despite a high number of concussions in RIRP, differences in mental health, social or work functioning were not found late after injury. Subtle group differences were detected on two cognitive tests, the cause of which is uncertain. Prospective group comparison studies on representative cohorts are required. "
2017-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease linked to repetitive head injuries. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy symptoms include changes in mood, behavior, cognition, and motor function; however, CTE is currently diagnosed only postmortem. Using a rat model of recurrent traumatic brain injury (TBI), we demonstrate rodent deficits that predict the severity of CTE-like brain pathology. Bilateral, closed-skull, mild TBI was administered once per week to 35 wild-type rats; eight rats received two injuries (2×TBI), 27 rats received five injuries (5×TBI), and 13 rats were sham controls. To determine clinical correlates for CTE diagnosis, TBI rats were separated based on the severity of rotarod deficits and classified as ""mild"" or ""severe"" and further separated into ""acute,"" ""short,"" and ""long"" based on age at euthanasia (90, 144, and 235 days, respectively). Brain atrophy, phosphorylated tau, and inflammation were assessed. All eight 2×TBI cases had mild rotarod deficiency, 11 5×TBI cases had mild deficiency, and 16 cases had severe deficiency. In one cohort of rats, tested at approximately 235 days of age, balance, rearing, and grip strength were significantly worse in the severe group relative to both sham and mild groups. At the acute time period, cortical thinning, phosphorylated tau, and inflammation were not observed in either TBI group, whereas corpus callosum thinning was observed in both TBI groups. At later time points, atrophy, tau pathology, and inflammation were increased in mild and severe TBI groups in the cortex and corpus callosum, relative to sham controls. These injury effects were exacerbated over time in the severe TBI group in the corpus callosum. Our model of repeat mild TBI suggests that permanent deficits in specific motor function tests correlate with CTE-like brain pathology. Assessing balance and motor coordination over time may predict CTE diagnosis. "
2017-06-01,"Advanced diffusion MRI methods have recently been proposed for detection of pathologies such as traumatic axonal injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy which commonly affect complex cortical brain regions. However, radiological-pathological correlations in human brain tissue that detail the relationship between the multi-component diffusion signal and underlying pathology are lacking. We present a nonlinear voxel based two dimensional coregistration method that is useful for matching diffusion signals to quantitative metrics of high resolution histological images. When validated in ex vivo human cortical tissue at a 250×250×500 μm spatial resolution, the method proved robust in correlations between generalized q-sampling imaging and histologically based white matter fiber orientations, with r=0.94 for the primary fiber direction and r=0.88 for secondary fiber direction in each voxel. Importantly, however, the correlation was substantially worse with reduced spatial resolution or with fiber orientations derived using a diffusion tensor model. Furthermore, we have detailed a quantitative histological metric of white matter fiber integrity termed power coherence capable of distinguishing architecturally complex but intact white matter from disrupted white matter regions. These methods may allow for more sensitive and specific radiological-pathological correlations of neurodegenerative diseases affecting complex gray and white matter. "
2017-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) evolved from the term dementia pugilistica describing the dementia found in many boxers to its current use in describing the dementia and depression sometimes found in athletes subjected to multiple concussions or subconcussive blows to the head. Concurrently, the neuropathology evolved to specify a unique type of tauopathy found in perivascular spaces at the depth of sulci and other features not typically seen in neurodegenerative tauopathies. Four stages of CTE have been proposed, with 4 corresponding clinical syndromes of traumatic encephalopathy syndrome. However, it remains unclear whether this is a syndrome unique to repetitive head trauma, especially in contact sports, because the epidemiology has been difficult to establish. In particular, research to date has had a denominator problem in not establishing the total number of potential cases at risk for developing CTE. The current review examines the evidence to date for these syndromes and contributing or complicating factors affecting the neuropathology, neuroimaging, and clinical presentations associated with them. "
2017-06-01,"Repeated head impacts have been suggested to be associated with the development of the neurodegenerative disorder, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau within the brain, with accompanying cognitive and behavioral deficits. How a history of repeated head impacts can lead to the later development of CTE is not yet known, and as such appropriate animal models are required. Over the last decade a number of rodent models of repeated mild traumatic brain injury have been developed that are broadly based on traditional traumatic brain injury models, in controlled cortical impact, fluid percussion and weight drop models, with adaptations to allow for better modeling of the mechanical forces associated with concussion.

2017-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is associated with repetitive head injury and has distinctive neuropathological features that differentiate this disease from other neurodegenerative diseases. Intraneuronal tau aggregates, although they occur in different patterns, are diagnostic neuropathological features of CTE, but the precise mechanism of tauopathy is not known in CTE. We performed whole RNA sequencing analysis of post-mortem brain tissue from patients with CTE and compared the results to normal controls to determine the transcriptome signature changes associated with CTE. The results showed that the genes related to the MAP kinase and calcium-signaling pathways were significantly downregulated in CTE. The altered expression of protein phosphatases (PPs) in these networks further suggested that the tauopathy observed in CTE involves common pathological mechanisms similar to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using cell lines and animal models, we also showed that reduced PPP3CA/PP2B phosphatase activity is directly associated with increases in phosphorylated (p)-tau proteins. These findings provide important insights into PP-dependent neurodegeneration and may lead to novel therapeutic approaches to reduce the tauopathy associated with CTE. "
2017-05-01,"CTE has two prominent components: the pathophysiology that is detected in the brain postmortem and the symptomology that is present in the interval between retirement and end of life. CTE symptomology has been noted to include memory difficulties, aggression, depression, explosivity, and executive dysfunction at early stages progressing to problems with attention, mood swings, visuospatial difficulties, confusion, progressive dementia, and suicidality (e.g. McKee et al. (2012), Omalu et al. (2010a-c), McKee et al. (2009)). There are a number of assumptions embedded within the current CTE literature: The first is the assumption that CTE symptomology reported by athletes and their families is the product of the pathophysiology change detected post-mortem (e.g. McKee et al. (2009)). At present, there is little scientific evidence to suggest that all CTE symptomology is the product of CTE pathophysiology. It has been assumed that CTE pathophysiology causes CTE symptomology (Meehan et al. (2015), Iverson et al. (2016)) but this link has never been scientifically validated. The purpose of the present work is to provide a multi-factorial theoretical framework to account for the symptomology reported by some athletes who sustain neurotrauma during their careers that will lead to a more systematic approach to understanding post-career symptomology. There is significant overlap between the case reports of athletes with post-mortem diagnoses of CTE, and symptom profiles of those with a history of substance use, chronic pain, and athlete career transition stress. The athlete post-career adjustment (AP-CA) model is intended to explain some of the symptoms that athletes experience at the end of their careers or during retirement. The AP-CA model consists of four elements: neurotrauma, chronic pain, substance use, and career transition stress. Based on the existing literature, it is clear that any one of the four elements of the AP-CA model can account for a significant number of CTE symptoms. In addition, depression can be a chronic lifelong co-morbid condition that may be present prior to an athletic career, or may be developed secondary to any of the model elements as shown in Fig. 1. Notably, neurotrauma is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition, for the development of CTE symptomology. "

It remains unknown whether CTE occurs exclusively after rTBI, or whether a single TBI (sTBI) can cause CTE. Similarly, it is unclear whether impact (eg, motor vehicle accidents) and non-impact (eg, blasts) types of energy transfer trigger divergent or common pathologies. While it is established that a history of rTBI increases the risk of multiple neurodegenerative diseases (eg, dementia, parkinsonism, and CTE), the possible pathophysiologic and molecular mechanisms underlying these risks have yet to be elucidated.

2017-04-01,"Neuroinflammation is a pathophysiological process present in a number of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury including chronic traumatic encephalopathy and other age-related CNS disorders. Although there is still much debate about the initial trigger for some of these neurodegenerative disorders, during the progression of disease, broad range anti-inflammatory drugs including cytokine suppressive anti-inflammatory drugs (CSAIDs) might be promising therapeutic options to limit neuroinflammation and improve the clinical outcome. One of the most promising CSAIDs is curcumin, which modulates the activity of several transcription factors (e.g., STAT, NF-κB, AP-1) and their pro-inflammatory molecular signaling pathways. However, normal curcumin preparations demonstrate low bioavailability in vivo. To increase bioavailability, preparations of high bioavailability curcumin have been introduced to achieve therapeutically relevant concentrations in target tissues. This literature review aims to summarize the pharmacokinetic and toxicity profile of different curcumin formulations. "
2017-07-01,"Acute brain injuries, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, as well as traumatic brain injury (TBI), are major worldwide health concerns with very limited options for effective diagnosis and treatment. Stroke and TBI pose an increased risk for the development of chronic neurodegenerative diseases, notably chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease. The existence of premorbid neurodegenerative diseases can exacerbate the severity and prognosis of acute brain injuries. Apoptosis involving caspase-3 is one of the most common mechanisms involved in the etiopathology of both acute and chronic neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a relationship between these disorders. Over the past two decades, several clinical biomarkers of apoptosis have been identified in cerebrospinal fluid and peripheral blood following ischemic stroke, intracerebral and subarachnoid hemorrhage, and TBI. These biomarkers include selected caspases, notably caspase-3 and its specific cleavage products such as caspase-cleaved cytokeratin-18, caspase-cleaved tau, and a caspase-specific 120 kDa αII-spectrin breakdown product. The levels of these biomarkers might be a valuable tool for the identification of pathological pathways such as apoptosis and inflammation involved in injury progression, assessment of injury severity, and prediction of clinical outcomes. This review focuses on clinical studies involving biomarkers of caspase-3-mediated pathways, following stroke and TBI. The review further examines their prospective diagnostic utility, as well as clinical utility for improved personalized treatment of stroke and TBI patients and the development of prophylactic treatment chronic neurodegenerative disease.

2017-04-01,"The term ""aging-related tau astrogliopathy"" (ARTAG) describes pathological accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau protein in astrocytes. We evaluated the correlates of ARTAG types (i.e., subpial, subependymal, white and gray matter, and perivascular) in different neuroanatomical regions. Clinical, neuropathological, and genetic (eg, APOE ε4 allele, MAPT H1/H2 haplotype) data from 628 postmortem brains from subjects were investigated; most of the patients had been longitudinally followed at the University of Pennsylvania. We found that (i) the amygdala is a hotspot for all ARTAG types; (ii) age at death, male sex, and presence of primary frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) tauopathy are significantly associated with ARTAG; (iii) age at death, greater degree of brain atrophy, ventricular enlargement, and Alzheimer disease (AD)-related variables are associated with subpial, white matter, and perivascular ARTAG types; (iv) AD-related variables are associated particularly with lobar white matter ARTAG; and (v) gray matter ARTAG in primary FTLD-tauopathies appears in areas without neuronal tau pathology. We provide a reference map of ARTAG types and propose at least 5 constellations of ARTAG. Furthermore, we propose a conceptual link between primary FTLD-tauopathy and ARTAG-related astrocytic tau pathologies. Our observations serve as a basis for etiological stratification and definition of progression patterns of ARTAG. "
2017-04-01,"A progressive loss of neuronal structure and function is a signature of many neurodegenerative conditions including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Parkinson's, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. Mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative and nitrative stress have been implicated as key pathological mechanisms underlying the neurodegenerative processes. However, current therapeutic approaches targeting oxidative damage are ineffective in preventing the progression of neurodegeneration. Mitochondria-targeted antioxidants were recently shown to alleviate oxidative damage. In this work, we investigated the delivery of biodegradable polyanhydride nanoparticles containing the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant apocynin to neuronal cells and the ability of the nano-formulation to protect cells against oxidative stress. The nano-formulated mitochondria-targeted apocynin provided excellent protection against oxidative stress-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and neuronal damage in a dopaminergic neuronal cell line, mouse primary cortical neurons, and a human mesencephalic cell line.

2017-04-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a neurodegenerative disease produced by accumulated minor traumatic brain injuries; no definitive premortem diagnosis and no treatments are available for chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Risk factors associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy include playing contact sports, presence of the apolipoprotein E4, and old age. Although it shares certain histopathological findings with Alzheimer disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy has a more specific presentation (hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposited as neurofibrillary tangles, associated with neuropil threads and sometimes with beta-amyloid plaques). Its clinical presentation is insidious; patients show mild cognitive and emotional symptoms before progressing to parkinsonian motor signs and finally dementia. Results from new experimental diagnostic tools are promising, but these tools are not yet available. The mainstay of managing this disease is prevention and early detection of its first symptoms. "
2017-03-01,"Traumatic brain injury represents major public health problem worldwide. A typical form of brain injuries is the injury suffered during sports, which according to severity ranges from mild injuries to fatal damages. The significance of the sport related minor head injuries derives form the high incidence, the excessive involvement of the younger age groups, and their potential repetitive nature. The repeated mild head injuries may accumulate, leading to complex structural, neurochemical, neuroendocrine, and psychological alterations, which in long term may result in changes of the patients quality of life and in significant deterioration of participation in the everyday activity. Actually we neither have enough knowledge about the ne-gative consequences, nor the way of prevention, or protection against the harmful long term results. With this study summary we would like to draw attention to the potential hazards emerging from sport injuries, moreover we would like to emphasize the importance of study participation and follow up of articles in this field. A baleseti agysérülés (TBI) jelentős köz-, népegészségügyi problémát jelent szerte a világon. A koponyatraumák egyik jellegzetes formája a sportolás kapcsán elszenvedett agysérülés, mely súlyosság tekintetében az enyhétől egészen a fatális sérülésekig terjedhet. A sportokkal összefüggő minor fejtraumák jelentőségét a magas incidencia, a fiatal korosztály nagymértékű bevonódása, illetve azok potenciálisan ismétlődő (repetitív) jellege adja. Az ismételt enyhe koponyatraumák kumulálódva ugyanis komplex strukturális, neurokémiai, neuroendrokrin és pszichológiai változásokhoz vezethetnek, melyek hosszú távon fennmaradva a traumát elszenvedett egyén életminőségének, a mindennapi tevékenységekben való részvételének jelentős romlását eredményezhetik.

2017-03-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative disorder associated with repetitive traumatic brain injury. One of the primary defining neuropathological lesions in CTE, based on the first consensus conference, is the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in gray matter sulcal depths. Post-mortem CTE studies have also reported myelin loss, axonal injury and white matter degeneration. Currently, the diagnosis of CTE is restricted to post-mortem neuropathological analysis. We hypothesized that high spatial resolution advanced diffusion MRI might be useful for detecting white matter microstructural changes directly adjacent to gray matter tau pathology. To test this hypothesis, formalin-fixed post-mortem tissue blocks from the superior frontal cortex of ten individuals with an established diagnosis of CTE were obtained from the Veterans Affairs-Boston University-Concussion Legacy Foundation brain bank. Advanced diffusion MRI data was acquired using an 11.74 T MRI scanner at Washington University with 250 × 250 × 500 µm "
2017-03-01,"In retired professional association football (soccer) players with a past history of repetitive head impacts, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a potential neurodegenerative cause of dementia and motor impairments. From 1980 to 2010, 14 retired footballers with dementia were followed up regularly until death. Their clinical data, playing career, and concussion history were prospectively collected. Next-of-kin provided consent for six to have post-mortem brain examination. Of the 14 male participants, 13 were professional and 1 was a committed amateur. All were skilled headers of the ball and had played football for an average of 26 years. Concussion rate was limited in six cases to one episode each during their careers. All cases developed progressive cognitive impairment with an average age at onset of 63.6 years and disease duration of 10 years. Neuropathological examination revealed septal abnormalities in all six post-mortem cases, supportive of a history of chronic repetitive head impacts. Four cases had pathologically confirmed CTE; concomitant pathologies included Alzheimer's disease (N = 6), TDP-43 (N = 6), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (N = 5), hippocampal sclerosis (N = 2), corticobasal degeneration (N = 1), dementia with Lewy bodies (N = 1), and vascular pathology (N = 1); and all would have contributed synergistically to the clinical manifestations. The pathological diagnosis of CTE was established in four individuals according to the latest consensus diagnostic criteria. This finding is probably related to their past prolonged exposure to repetitive head impacts from head-to-player collisions and heading the ball thousands of time throughout their careers. Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies are common concomitant findings in CTE, both of which are increasingly considered as part of the CTE pathological entity in older individuals. Association football is the most popular sport in the world and the potential link between repetitive head impacts from playing football and CTE as indicated from our findings is of considerable public health interest. Clearly, a definitive link cannot be established in this clinico-pathological series, but our findings support the need for further systematic investigation, including large-scale case-control studies to identify at risk groups of footballers which will justify for the implementation of protective strategies.

2017-03-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive mild impact traumatic brain injury from contact sports. Recently, a consensus panel defined the pathognomonic lesion for CTE as accumulations of abnormally hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons (neurofibrillary tangles), astrocytes and cell processes distributed around small blood vessels at sulcal depths in irregular patterns within the cortex. The pathophysiological mechanism for this lesion is unknown. Moreover, a subset of CTE cases harbors cortical β-amyloid plaques. In this study, we analyzed postmortem brain tissues from five institutionalized patients with schizophrenia and history of surgical leucotomy with subsequent survival of at least another 40 years. Because leucotomy involves severing axons bilaterally in prefrontal cortex, this surgical procedure represents a human model of single traumatic brain injury with severe axonal damage and no external impact. We examined cortical tissues at the leucotomy site and at both prefrontal cortex rostral and frontal cortex caudal to the leucotomy site. For comparison, we analyzed brain tissues at equivalent neuroanatomical sites from non-leucotomized patients with schizophrenia, matched in age and gender. All five leucotomy cases revealed severe white matter damage with dense astrogliosis at the axotomy site and also neurofibrillary tangles and p-tau immunoreactive neurites in the overlying gray matter. Four cases displayed p-tau immunoreactivity in neurons, astrocytes and cell processes encompassing blood vessels at cortical sulcal depths in irregular patterns, similar to CTE. The three cases with apolipoprotein E ε4 haplotype showed scattered β-amyloid plaques in the overlying gray matter, but not the two cases with apolipoprotein E ε3/3 genotype. Brain tissue samples from prefrontal cortex rostral and frontal cortex caudal to the leucotomy site, and all cortical samples from the non-leucotomized patients, showed minimal p-tau and β-amyloid pathology. These findings suggest that chronic axonal damage contributes to the unique pathology of CTE over time. "
2017-03-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), advanced age, and cerebral vascular disease are factors conferring increased risk for late onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). These conditions are also related pathologically through multiple interacting mechanisms. The hallmark pathology of AD consists of pathological aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and tau proteins. These molecules are also involved in neuropathology of several other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and are under intense investigation in the aftermath of TBI as potential contributors to the risk for developing AD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The pathology of TBI is complex and dependent on injury severity, age-at-injury, and length of time between injury and neuropathological evaluation. In addition, the mechanisms influencing pathology and recovery after TBI likely involve genetic/epigenetic factors as well as additional disorders or comorbid states related to age and central and peripheral vascular health. In this regard, dysfunction of the aging neurovascular system could be an important link between TBI and chronic neurodegenerative diseases, either as a precipitating event or related to accumulation of AD-like pathology which is amplified in the context of aging. Thus with advanced age and vascular dysfunction, TBI can trigger self-propagating cycles of neuronal injury, pathological protein aggregation, and synaptic loss resulting in chronic neurodegenerative disease. In this review we discuss evidence supporting TBI and aging as dual, interacting risk factors for AD, and the role of Aβ and cerebral vascular dysfunction in this relationship. Evidence is discussed that Aβ is involved in cyto- and synapto-toxicity after severe TBI, and that its chronic effects are potentiated by aging and impaired cerebral vascular function. From a therapeutic perspective, we emphasize that in the fields of TBI- and aging-related neurodegeneration protective strategies should include preservation of neurovascular function. "
2017-03-01,"The current study aimed to assess current broad traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related knowledge in the general public, as well as understanding regarding specific TBI-related conditions including post-concussive syndrome (PCS) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Data were collected from 307 domestic and 73 international individuals via online researcher-developed survey instrumentation utilizing the Amazon Mechanical Turk marketplace, a recently developed website that allows for a streamlined process of survey-based participant recruitment and data collection. Participants completed background demographics questions, a 31-item true/false questionnaire pertaining to TBI-related knowledge, and an inquiry related to willingness to allow (future) child(ren) to participate in several popular U.S. sports. The overall accuracy rate of our U.S. sample was 61%. No accuracy differences were present for gender or geographic region (p's > .05). Participants who self-reported a prior concussion diagnosis, who reported receiving formal concussion training, and who endorsed participation in collegiate, semi-professional, or professional athletic competition, all exhibited lower accuracy rates than the respective comparison groups (p's < .001). Finally, individual item analysis revealed the presence of significant misconceptions pertaining to PCS and CTE. Misconceptions regarding TBI remain highly prevalent within the general public and may be explained, to some extent, by inefficiencies in current TBI-education practices. Moreover, misconceptions regarding PCS and CTE are also prevalent and likely reflect inconsistencies in the scientific literature, coupled with misleading media reports. To combat these trends, greater emphasis must be placed on construct definition within the field and streamlined, efficient communication with the general public. "

2017-03-01,"Helmets are one of the earliest and most enduring methods of personal protection in human civilization. Although primarily developed for combat purposes in ancient times, modern helmets have become highly diversified to sports, recreation, and transportation. History and the scientific literature exhibit that helmets continue to be the primary and most effective prevention method against traumatic brain injury (TBI), which presents high mortality and morbidity rates in the US. The neurosurgical and neurotrauma literature on helmets and TBI indicate that helmets provide effectual protection against moderate to severe head trauma resulting in severe disability or death. However, there is a dearth of scientific data on helmet efficacy against concussion in both civilian and military aspects. The objective of this literature review was to explore the historical evolution of helmets, consider the effectiveness of helmets in protecting against severe intracranial injuries, and examine recent evidence on helmet efficacy against concussion. It was also the goal of this report to emphasize the need for more research on helmet efficacy with improved experimental design and quantitative standardization of assessments for concussion and TBI, and to promote expanded involvement of neurosurgery in studying the quantitative diagnostics of concussion and TBI. Recent evidence summarized by this literature review suggests that helmeted patients do not have better relative clinical outcome and protection against concussion than unhelmeted patients. "
2017-02-01,"Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by distinctive neuropathological alterations, including the cerebral accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates, neuroinflammation, synaptic dysfunction, and neuronal loss, along with behavioral impairments. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is believed to be an important risk factor for certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). TBI represents a ubiquitous problem in the world and could play a major role in the pathogenesis and etiology of AD or CTE later in life. TBI events appear to trigger and exacerbate some of the pathological processes in these diseases, in particular, the formation and accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates composed of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau. Here, we describe the relationship between repetitive mild TBI and the development of Aβ and tau pathology in patients affected by AD or CTE on the basis of epidemiological and pathological studies in human cases, and a thorough overview of data obtained in experimental animal models. We also discuss the possibility that TBI may contribute to initiate the formation of misfolded oligomeric species that may subsequently spread the pathology through a prion-like process of seeding of protein misfolding.

2017-02-01,"Concussion is increasingly recognized as a risk of participation in contact and collision sports. There have been few examinations of athletes' perceptions of their susceptibility to concussion or concussion-related health consequences. We examine college football players' perceptions of their risk of sustaining a concussion and concussion-related health consequences in their future, whether these perceptions change over time, and how concussion history is related to perceived future risk of concussion and concussion-related health consequences. A survey was administered to National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Football Championship Series athletes on 10 teams in 2013 and to nine of those teams in 2014. Athletes answered questions assessing their perceptions of concussion and potential concussion-related health consequences. Approximately 40% of athletes believed there was a strong possibility that they would sustain a concussion in the future, while approximately one-in-four thought a concussion would make them miss a few games. About one-in-10 athletes predicted dementia, Alzheimer's disease, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy would develop from concussions. These beliefs were stronger among athletes who had sustained previous concussions. Across the two years studied, athletes' perceptions of the risk of concussion and missing a few games because of concussion decreased significantly. Overall, a substantial proportion of college football players believe they will have long-term health consequences as a result of sustaining sport-related concussions. The true incidence and prevalence of many of these outcomes are unknown. Further research is needed to determine whether athletes have an accurate perception of the risks of these outcomes developing. "
2017-02-01,"Professional American football players incur thousands of repetitive head impacts (RHIs) throughout their lifetime. The long-term consequences of RHI are not well characterized, but may include olfactory dysfunction. RHI has been associated with changes to brain regions involved in olfaction, and olfactory impairment is common after traumatic brain injury. Olfactory dysfunction is a frequent early sequelae of neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's disease), and RHI is associated with the neurodegenerative disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We examined olfaction, and its association with clinical measures, in former National Football League (NFL) players. Ninety-five former NFL players (ages 40-69) and 28 same-age controls completed a neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric evaluation as part of a National Institutes of Health-funded study. The Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) assessed olfaction. Principal component analysis generated a four-factor structure of the clinical measures: behavioral/mood, psychomotor speed/executive function, and verbal and visual memory. Former NFL players had worse B-SIT scores relative to controls (p = 0.0096). A B-SIT cutoff of 11 had the greatest accuracy (c-statistic = 0.61) and specificity (79%) for discriminating former NFL players from controls. In the former NFL players, lower B-SIT scores correlated with greater behavioral/mood impairment (p = 0.0254) and worse psychomotor speed/executive functioning (p = 0.0464) after controlling for age and education. Former NFL players exhibited lower olfactory test scores relative to controls, and poorer olfactory test performance was associated with worse neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric functioning. Future work that uses more-comprehensive tests of olfaction and structural and functioning neuroimaging may improve understanding on the association between RHI and olfaction. "
2017-03-01,"Concussion - also known as mild traumatic brain injury - is a transient disturbance of neurological function resulting from traumatic forces imparted to the brain that often produce cognitive, behavioral and systemic symptoms.

2017-02-01,"Traumatic brain injury can lead to the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This condition has a clear neuropathological definition but the relationship between the initial head impact and the pattern of progressive brain pathology is poorly understood. We test the hypothesis that mechanical strain and strain rate are greatest in sulci, where neuropathology is prominently seen in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and whether human neuroimaging observations converge with computational predictions. Three distinct types of injury were simulated. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy can occur after sporting injuries, so we studied a helmet-to-helmet impact in an American football game. In addition, we investigated an occipital head impact due to a fall from ground level and a helmeted head impact in a road traffic accident involving a motorcycle and a car. A high fidelity 3D computational model of brain injury biomechanics was developed and the contours of strain and strain rate at the grey matter-white matter boundary were mapped. Diffusion tensor imaging abnormalities in a cohort of 97 traumatic brain injury patients were also mapped at the grey matter-white matter boundary. Fifty-one healthy subjects served as controls. The computational models predicted large strain most prominent at the depths of sulci. The volume fraction of sulcal regions exceeding brain injury thresholds were significantly larger than that of gyral regions. Strain and strain rates were highest for the road traffic accident and sporting injury. Strain was greater in the sulci for all injury types, but strain rate was greater only in the road traffic and sporting injuries. Diffusion tensor imaging showed converging imaging abnormalities within sulcal regions with a significant decrease in fractional anisotropy in the patient group compared to controls within the sulci. Our results show that brain tissue deformation induced by head impact loading is greatest in sulcal locations, where pathology in cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy is observed. In addition, the nature of initial head loading can have a significant influence on the magnitude and pattern of injury. Clarifying this relationship is key to understanding the long-term effects of head impacts and improving protective strategies, such as helmet design. "
2017-02-01,"A history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is linked to an increased risk for the later development of dementia. This encompasses a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), with AD linked to history of moderate-severe TBI and CTE to a history of repeated concussion. Of note, both AD and CTE are characterized by the abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates, which are thought to play an important role in the development of neurodegeneration. Hyperphosphorylation of tau leads to destabilization of microtubules, interrupting axonal transport, whilst tau aggregates are associated with synaptic dysfunction. The exact mechanisms via which TBI may promote the later tauopathy and its role in the later development of dementia are yet to be fully determined. Following TBI, it is proposed that axonal injury may provide the initial perturbation of tau, by promoting its dissociation from microtubules, facilitating its phosphorylation and aggregation. Altered tau dynamics may then be exacerbated by the chronic persistent inflammatory response that has been shown to persist for decades following the initial impact. Importantly, immune activation has been shown to play a role in accelerating disease progression in other tauopathies, with pro-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-1β, shown to activate kinases that promote tau hyperphosphorylation. Thus, targeting the inflammatory response in the sub-acute phase following TBI may represent a promising target to halt the alterations in tau dynamics that may precede overt neurodegeneration and later development of dementia. "
2017-02-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disorder which may result from repetitive brain injury. A variety of tau-immunoreactive pathologies are present, including neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), neuropil threads (NT), dot-like grains (DLG), astrocytic tangles (AT), and occasional neuritic plaques (NP). In tauopathies, cellular inclusions in the cortex are clustered within specific laminae, the clusters being regularly distributed parallel to the pia mater. To determine whether a similar spatial pattern is present in CTE, clustering of the tau-immunoreactive pathology was studied in the cortex, hippocampus, and dentate gyrus in 11 cases of CTE and 7 cases of Alzheimer's disease neuropathologic change (ADNC) without CTE. In CTE: (1) all aspects of tau-immunoreactive pathology were clustered and the clusters were frequently regularly distributed parallel to the tissue boundary, (2) clustering was similar in two CTE cases with minimal co-pathology compared with cases with associated ADNC or TDP-43 proteinopathy, (3) in a proportion of cortical gyri, estimated cluster size was similar to that of cell columns of the cortico-cortical pathways, and (4) clusters of the tau-immunoreactive pathology were infrequently spatially correlated with blood vessels. The NFT and NP in ADNC without CTE were less frequently randomly or uniformly distributed and more frequently in defined clusters than in CTE. Hence, the spatial pattern of the tau-immunoreactive pathology observed in CTE is typical of the tauopathies but with some distinct differences compared to ADNC alone. The spread of pathogenic tau along anatomical pathways could be a factor in the pathogenesis of the disease. "

2017-02-01,"Transactivating DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43) inclusions and the accumulation of phosphorylated and ubiquitinated tau proteins (p-tau) have been identified in postmortem brain specimens from patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). To examine whether these proteins contribute to the development of CTE, we utilized an in vitro trauma system known to reproduce many of the findings observed in humans and experimental animals with traumatic brain injury. Accordingly, we examined the role of TDP-43 and Tau in an in vitro model of trauma, and determined whether these proteins contribute to the defective neuronal integrity associated with CNS trauma. Single or multiple episodes of trauma to cultured neurons resulted in a time-dependent increase in cytosolic levels of phosphorylated TDP-43 (p-TDP-43). Trauma to cultured neurons also caused an increase in levels of casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1ε), and ubiquitinated p-TDP-43, along with a decrease in importin-β (all factors known to mediate the ""TDP-43 proteinopathy""). Defective neuronal integrity, as evidenced by a reduction in levels of the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, and in PSD95, along with increased levels of phosphorylated tau were also observed. Additionally, increased levels of intra- and extracellular thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) (a factor known to regulate neuronal integrity) were observed in cultured astrocytes at early stages of trauma, while at later stages decreased levels were identified. The addition of recombinant TSP-1, conditioned media from cultured astrocytes at early stages of trauma, or the CK1ε inhibitor PF4800567 hydrochloride to traumatized cultured neurons reduced levels of p-TDP-43, and reversed the trauma-induced decline in NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor and PSD95 levels. These findings suggest that a trauma-induced increase in TDP-43 phosphorylation contributes to defective neuronal integrity, and that increasing TSP-1 levels may represent a useful therapeutic approach for the prevention of the neuronal TDP-43 proteinopathy associated with CTE.

2017-02-01,"To quantify tau pathology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and investigate influence of dot-like lesions (DL), brain region, comorbidity and sporting career length. Densities of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), astrocytic tangles (AT), DL, oligodendroglial inclusions (GI), neuropil threads (NT), vacuoles, neurons and enlarged neurons (EN) were measured in tau-immunoreactive sections of upper cortical laminae of frontal and temporal lobes, hippocampus (HC), amygdala and substantia nigra (SN) in 11 cases of CTE. DL were a consistent finding in CTE. Densities of NFT, NT and DL were greatest in sectors CA1 and CA2 of the HC. Densities of AT were lower than NFT, small numbers of GI were recorded in temporal lobe and low densities of vacuoles and EN were consistently present. β-Amyloid-containing neuritic plaques (NP) also occurred at low density. Densities of NFT, NT, DL and AT were greater in sulci than gyri, while vacuole density was greater in gyri. Principal components analysis (PCA) suggested that sporting career length and densities of NFT in entorhinal cortex, NT in CA2 and SN and vacuolation in the DG were significant sources of variation among cases. DL are frequent in CTE suggesting affinity with argyrophilic grain disease (AGD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PD-Dem). Densities of AT in all regions and NT/DL in sectors CA2/4 were consistent features of CTE. The 11 cases are neuropathologically heterogeneous which may result from genetic diversity, and variation in anatomical pathways subjected to trauma. "
2017-01-01,"Individuals with a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) are at increased risk for a number of disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, mediators of the long-term morbidity are uncertain. We conducted a multi-site, prospective trial in chronic TBI patients (∼18 years post-TBI) living in long-term 24-h care environments and local controls without a history of head injury. Inability to give informed consent was exclusionary for participation. A total of 41 individuals (17 moderate-severe TBI, 24 controls) were studied before and after consumption of a standardized breakfast to determine if concentrations of amino acids, cytokines, C-reactive protein, and insulin are potential mediators of long-term TBI morbidity. Analyte concentrations were measured in serum drawn before (fasting) and 1 h after meal consumption. Mean ages were 44 ± 15 and 49 ± 11 years for controls and chronic TBI patients, respectively. Chronic TBI patients had significantly lower circulating concentrations of numerous individual amino acids, as well as essential amino acids (p = 0.03) and large neutral amino acids (p = 0.003) considered as groups, and displayed fundamentally altered cytokine-amino acid relationships. Many years after injury, TBI patients exhibit abnormal metabolic responses and altered relationships between circulating amino acids, cytokines, and hormones. This pattern is consistent with TBI, inducing a chronic disease state in patients. Understanding the mechanisms causing the chronic disease state could lead to new treatments for its prevention. "
2017-01-01,"The term ""repetitive head impacts"" (RHI) refers to the cumulative exposure to concussive and subconcussive events. Although RHI are believed to increase risk for later-life neurological consequences (including chronic traumatic encephalopathy), quantitative analysis of this relationship has not yet been examined because of the lack of validated tools to quantify lifetime RHI exposure. The objectives of this study were: 1) to develop a metric to quantify cumulative RHI exposure from football, which we term the ""cumulative head impact index"" (CHII); 2) to use the CHII to examine the association between RHI exposure and long-term clinical outcomes; and 3) to evaluate its predictive properties relative to other exposure metrics (i.e., duration of play, age of first exposure, concussion history). Participants included 93 former high school and collegiate football players who completed objective cognitive and self-reported behavioral/mood tests as part of a larger ongoing longitudinal study. Using established cutoff scores, we transformed continuous outcomes into dichotomous variables (normal vs. impaired). The CHII was computed for each participant and derived from a combination of self-reported athletic history (i.e., number of seasons, position[s], levels played), and impact frequencies reported in helmet accelerometer studies. A bivariate probit, instrumental variable model revealed a threshold dose-response relationship between the CHII and risk for later-life cognitive impairment (p < 0.0001), self-reported executive dysfunction (p < 0.0001), depression (p < 0.0001), apathy (p = 0.0161), and behavioral dysregulation (p < 0.0001). Ultimately, the CHII demonstrated greater predictive validity than other individual exposure metrics. "
2018-11-01,"Although millions of individuals suffer a traumatic brain injury (TBI) worldwide each year, it is only recently that TBI has been recognized as a major public health problem. Beyond the acute clinical manifestations, there is growing recognition that a single severe TBI (sTBI) or repeated mild TBIs (rTBI) can also induce insidious neurodegenerative processes, which may be associated with early dementia, in particular chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Identified at autopsy examination in individuals with histories of exposure to sTBI or rTBI, CTE is recognized as a complex pathology featuring both macroscopic and microscopic abnormalities. These include cavum septum pellucidum, brain atrophy and ventricular dilation, together with pathologies in tau, TDP-43, and amyloid-β. However, the establishment and characterization of CTE as a distinct disease entity is in its infancy. Moreover, the relative ""dose"" of TBI, such as the frequency and severity of injury, associated with risk of CTE remains unknown. As such, there is a clear and pressing need to improve the recognition and diagnosis of CTE and to identify mechanistic links between TBI and chronic neurodegeneration. "
2018-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a widely recognized risk factor for neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this review is to provide an update on the state of the science related to injury cascades in TBI-related neurodegeneration. Acute and chronic pathological outcomes of TBI are similar to those seen in several neurodegenerative conditions, suggesting common linking pathways. Initial research described severe TBI patients with post-mortem identification of abnormal proteins, such as amyloid deposits. History of mild TBI (mTBI) is less consistently associated with heightened risk of neurodegenerative outcomes, but specific populations with complicated medical histories and comorbidities may be more susceptible. Our understanding of a pathological signature associated with repetitive mTBI and/or subclinical brain trauma advanced significantly over the past decade, and is now commonly referred to as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We discuss hypotheses linking TBI to neurodegenerative disease, and the importance of considering factors like injury severity, timing of injury (early life versus older age), injury frequency, and repetitive subclinical brain trauma when extrapolating results from current literature to certain populations. We describe the challenges to obtaining the data necessary for accurate epidemiological research and determination of true risk magnitude, and note the importance of developing treatment-based approaches to risk mitigation.

2018-11-01,"There is evidence that repetitive mild traumatic brain injury leads to specific patterns of neuropathological findings, labeled chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, questions remain about whether these neuropathological changes produce changes in behavior, cognition, and emotional status that are associated with a unique neuropsychiatric profile that can be assessed using currently available clinical tools. Our review of the literature indicates that insufficient evidence currently exists to suggest a distinct neuropsychiatric profile for CTE. Major limitations to the field presently include the relatively nascent nature of the topic, reliance on retrospective next-of-kin reporting, the lack of prospective studies, and similarities in neuropsychiatric symptoms between CTE, other neurodegenerative disorders and forms of psychopathology. Clinicians and researchers alike have a responsibility to adopt a cautious and balanced approach for antemortem assessments to minimize the potential unintended negative consequences of both overdiagnosing and underdiagnosing a clinical entity that has yet to be clearly established.

2018-01-01,"Tauopathies are neurodegenerative disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal tau protein in the brain. The spectrum of tau pathologies expands beyond the traditionally discussed disease forms like Pick disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and argyrophilic grain disease. Emerging entities and pathologies include globular glial tauopathies, primary age-related tauopathy, which includes neurofibrillary tangle dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and aging-related tau astrogliopathy. Clinical symptoms include frontotemporal dementia, corticobasal syndrome, Richardson syndrome, parkinsonism, pure akinesia with gait freezing and, rarely, motor neuron symptoms or cerebellar ataxia. Some disorders show specific neuroimaging features, while examination of the cerebrospinal fluid awaits markers for in vivo stratification of cases. The possibility of cell-to-cell propagation is a novel aspect of the pathogenesis of tauopathies, which is partly reflected by the hierarchic involvement of anatomic regions. This concept might have relevance for the development of therapies. For cost-effective screening for tau pathologies in neuropathologic practice, examination of the hippocampus, amygdala, and basal ganglia is recommended. Uncommon morphologies or unusually extensive forms of tau pathologies should raise the suspicion of a genetic background. Ongoing multidisciplinary studies are needed to understand the whole spectrum and significance of tau pathologies. "
2018-01-01,"Traumatic brain injury remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, affecting young and old alike. Pathologic data have been developed through observations of human autopsies and developing animal models to investigate mechanisms, although animal models do not represent the polypathology of human brain injury and there are likely to be significant differences in the anatomic basis of injury and cellular responses between species. Traumatic brain injury can be defined pathologically as either focal or diffuse, and can be considered to be either primary, directly related to the force associated with the neurotrauma, or secondary, developing as a downstream consequence of the neurotrauma. While neuropathology has traditionally focused on severe head injury, there is increasing recognition of the long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury, particularly repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, and a possible long-term association with chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

2017-03-01,"A neurocatastrophe or severe brain injury (SBI) is a central nervous system insult associated with a high likelihood of death or severe disability. While many etiologic processes may lead to SBI, the most common and best-studied clinical paradigms are traumatic brain injury and anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy following cardiac arrest. Clinical phenotypes following SBI include acute and chronic disorders of consciousness as well as a range of cognitive and behavioral impairments. A fundamental task for medical teams working in the acute phase is to estimate SBI recovery probabilities with the highest degree of accuracy possible. Predictions made on the basis of single features or variables lack discrimination and are generally supplanted by multivariable models that combine clinical, imaging, and laboratory data into tractable scoring systems. Yet existing scores fail to classify outcomes with the accuracy that would support individual patient-level decision making. Improved prognostication will likely depend on the use of molecular and imaging data that capture unique biologic features in individual patients with SBI. The integration of these additional layers of information will require iterative computational approaches. "
2018-02-01,"There is a long history linking traumatic brain injury (TBI) with the development of dementia. Despite significant reservations, such as recall bias or concluding causality for TBI, a summary of recent research points to several conclusions on the TBI-dementia relationship. 1) Increasing severity of a single moderate-to-severe TBI increases the risk of subsequent Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common type of dementia. 2) Repetitive, often subconcussive, mild TBIs increases the risk for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative neuropathology. 3) TBI may be a risk factor for other neurodegenerative disorders that can be associated with dementia. 4) TBI appears to lower the age of onset of TBI-related neurocognitive syndromes, potentially adding ""TBI cognitive-behavioral features"". The literature further indicates several specific risk factors for TBI-associated dementia: 5) any blast or blunt physical force to the head as long as there is violent head displacement; 6) decreased cognitive and/or neuronal reserve and the related variable of older age at TBI; and 7) the presence of apolipoprotein E ɛ4 alleles, a genetic risk factor for AD. Finally, there are neuropathological features relating TBI with neurocognitive syndromes: 8) acute TBI results in amyloid pathology and other neurodegenerative proteinopathies; 9) CTE shares features with neurodegenerative dementias; and 10) TBI results in white matter tract and neural network disruptions. Although further research is needed, these ten findings suggest that dose-dependent effects of violent head displacement in vulnerable brains predispose to dementia; among several potential mechanisms is the propagation of abnormal proteins along damaged white matter networks.

2018-10-01,"Because there is no standard reporting of injuries in jails and prisons, the national burden of head trauma during incarceration is unclear. We report on a case of repeated head trauma in the New York City (NYC) jail system, data on the incidence of head trauma and mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), and compare those findings with national estimates. The case report revealed 64 injurious events over two years, 44% resulting in a head injury and 25% resulting in emergency hospitalization. During the 42 months of this analysis, 10,286 incidents of head trauma occurred in the NYC jail system. Mild TBI occurred in 1,507 of these instances. The rate of head trauma and mTBI was 269.0 and 39.4 per 1,000 person-years, respectively. The lack of reporting head trauma in correctional settings means that national prevalence estimates of these critical health outcomes miss the vulnerable cohort of incarcerated individuals. "
2017-12-01,"Progressive neurodegenerative diseases plague millions of individuals both in the United States and across the world. The current pathology of progressive neurodegenerative tauopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Pick's disease, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy, primarily revolves around phosphorylation and hyperphosphorylation of the tau protein. However, more recent evidence suggests acetylation of tau protein at lysine 280 may be a critical step in molecular pathology of these neurodegenerative diseases prior to the tau hyperphosphorylation. Secondary injury cascades such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and neuroinflammation contribute to lasting damage within the brain and can be induced by a number of different risk factors. These injury cascades funnel into a common pathway of early tau acetylation, which may serve as the catalyst for progressive degeneration. The post translational modification of tau can result in production of toxic oligomers, contributing to reduced solubility as well as aggregation and formation of neurofibrillary tangles, the hallmark of AD pathology. Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repetitive brain trauma is also associated with a hyperphosphorylation of tau. We postulated acetylation of tau at lysine 280 in CTE disease could be present prior to the hyperphosphorylation and tested this hypothesis in CTE pathologic specimens. We also tested for ac-tau 280 in early stage Alzheimer's disease (Braak stage 1). Histopathological examination using the ac tau 280 antibody was performed in three Alzheimer's cases and three CTE patients. Presence of ac-tau 280 was confirmed in all cases at early sites of disease manifestation. These findings suggest that tau acetylation may precede tau phosphorylation and could be the first ""triggering"" event leading to neuronal loss. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify acetylation of the tau protein in CTE. Prevention of tau acetylation could possibly serve as a novel target for stopping neurodegeneration before it fully begins. In this study, we highlight what is known about tau acetylation and neurodegeneration. "
2016-08-01,This study conducted a preliminary examination on cognitive reserve (CR) as a modifier of symptom expression in subjects with autopsy-confirmed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The sample included 25 former professional football players neuropathologically diagnosed with CTE stage III or IV. Next of kin interviews ascertained age at cognitive and behavioral/mood symptom onset and demographic/athletic characteristics. Years of education and occupational attainment defined CR. High occupational achievement predicted later age at cognitive (p=0.02) and behavioral/mood (p=0.02) onset. Education was not an individual predictor. These preliminary findings suggest that CR may forestall the clinical manifestation of CTE. 
2014-09-01,"Approximately 3.8 million sports related TBIs occur per year. Genetic variation may affect both TBI risk and post-TBI clinical outcome. Limited research has focused on genetic risk for concussion among athletes. We describe the design, methods, and baseline characteristics of this prospective cohort study designed to investigate a potential association between genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E gene, APOE promoter G-219T, and Tau gene exon 6 polymorphisms (Ser53 Pro and Hist47Tyr) with: 1) the risk of prospective concussion; 2) concussion severity; and 3) postconcussion neurocognitive recovery. The prospective cohort study included a final population of 2947 college, high school, and professional athletes. Baseline data collection included a concussion/medical history questionnaire, neuropsychological (NP) testing, and genetic sampling for the genetic polymorphisms. Data collection on new concussions experienced utilized post-concussion history/mental status form, Lovell post-concussion symptom score, Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) and/or the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT)-1/SCAT-2, and post-concussion NP testing. This paper is focused on discussing the important methodological considerations, organizational challenges and lessons learned in the completion of a multi-center prospective cohort study. A total of 3740 subjects enrolled, with a total of 335 concussions experienced. Of critical importance to the success of a study of this type is to successfully recruit committed institutions with qualified local study personnel, obtain ""buy-in"" from study sites, and cultivate strong working relationships with study sites. The use of approved incentives may improve study site recruitment, enhance retention, and enhance compliance with study protocols. Future publications will detail the specific findings of this study. Collaborative research is very likely needed given the nature of this study population. "
2018-12-01,"- Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by repetitive head injuries like those seen in sports such as boxing, American football and soccer.- The clinical features of CTE are a range of cognitive, psychiatric and motor symptoms, and histopathology involves deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau protein and the presence of TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) with relatively little beta-amyloid.- CTE is difficult to differentiate clinically from Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and psychiatric disorders because of the major symptom overlap between these conditions.- The most important risk factors for developing CTE are the cumulative effect of repetitive head injuries, with or without clinical symptoms, and the duration of exposure to the repetitive injuries (the sporting career).- There is no treatment for CTE at present and the strategy must be primarily geared to prevention.- In view of the large number of people, including those in the Netherlands, who take part in sports in which head injuries may occur, research into CTE is of major societal importance.

2017-01-01,"To investigate neuropathological changes in the superior colliculus in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The densities of the tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, dot-like grains, astrocytic tangles, and neuritic plaques, together with abnormally enlarged neurons, typical neurons, vacuolation, and frequency of contacts with blood vessels, were studied across the superior colliculus from pia mater to the periaqueductal gray in eight chronic traumatic encephalopathy and six control cases. Tau-immunoreactive pathology was absent in the superior colliculus of controls but present in varying degrees in all chronic traumatic encephalopathy cases, significant densities of tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, NT, or dot-like grains being present in three cases. No significant differences in overall density of the tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, dot-like grains, enlarged neurons, vacuoles, or contacts with blood vessels were observed in control and chronic traumatic encephalopathy cases, but chronic traumatic encephalopathy cases had significantly lower mean densities of neurons. The distribution of surviving neurons across the superior colliculus suggested greater neuronal loss in intermediate and lower laminae in chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Changes in density of the tau-immunoreactive pathology across the laminae were variable, but in six chronic traumatic encephalopathy cases, densities of tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, or dot-like grains were significantly greater in intermediate and lower laminae. Pathological changes were not correlated with the distribution of blood vessels. The data suggest significant pathology affecting the superior colliculus in a proportion of chronic traumatic encephalopathy cases with a laminar distribution which could compromise motor function rather than sensory analysis.

2017-01-01,"A pediatrician is asked by her local school board to help them decide whether to discontinue their high school football program. She reviews the available evidence on the risks of football and finds it hopelessly contradictory. Some scholars claim that football is clearly more dangerous than other sports. Others suggest that the risks of football are comparable to other sports, such as lacrosse, ice hockey, or soccer. She finds very little data on the long-term sequelae of concussions. She sees claims that good coaching and a school culture that prioritizes the health of athletes over winning can reduce morbidity from sports injuries. In this paper, 3 experts also review the evidence about sports risks and discuss what is known and not known about the science and the ethics of high school football. "
2017-01-01,"Concussion is widely discussed in online sports news articles, but the terms used to report this injury vary. This study aimed to use a systematic search strategy and explore the description of sports concussion in online sports news articles. A systematic approach was employed to obtain online articles related to sports concussion from four sports associated with concussion (hockey, football, soccer, and rugby). Included articles were evaluated for the descriptors used in relation to concussion and possible consequences associated with concussion. Data was analysed to determine trends between each sport as well between the countries of origin of the articles. From 200 articles retrieved, 153 were included for analysis. The terms ""Head injury"" (30.1%) and ""Brain injury"" (20.9%) were most used to describe a concussive injury, and the most frequently mentioned consequence of concussion was ""Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy"" (15%). Modifiers which potentially play down the importance of the injury were noted in 9.8% of the articles, with journalists the primary source of these terms. The variability in reporting of concussion by online news articles may limit the transmission of correct concussion information to the public. To improve the consistency of this reporting, the ""Media Concussion Checklist"" was developed. "
2018-02-01,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) resulting from blast exposures have significantly affected US military personnel throughout the world, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. From 2000-2016, more than 350,000 military service members were diagnosed with a TBI. Since the majority of blast-related TBIs are classified as mild with no definitive findings on physical examination or diagnostic studies, it is difficult to accurately diagnose individuals inflicted with such injuries. There are likely far more mild TBIs that remain undiagnosed in the military. Traumatic brain injury is a serious public health concern since it can lead to long-term neuropsychiatric changes such as posttraumatic stress disorder and various forms of dementia. Blast-related TBI has also been linked with neuropsychiatric dysfunction that is commonly seen in athletes that have suffered chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Further research is needed to aid in prevention, diagnostic studies, and care of military service members and veterans who have suffered a TBI. "
2016-12-01,"Tau prions are thought to aggregate in the central nervous system, resulting in neurodegeneration. Among the tauopathies, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common, whereas argyrophilic grain disease (AGD), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Pick's disease (PiD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) are less prevalent. Brain extracts from deceased individuals with PiD, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by three-repeat (3R) tau prions, were used to infect HEK293T cells expressing 3R tau fused to yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Extracts from AGD, CBD, and PSP patient samples, which contain four-repeat (4R) tau prions, were transmitted to HEK293 cells expressing 4R tau fused to YFP. These studies demonstrated that prion propagation in HEK cells requires isoform pairing between the infecting prion and the recipient substrate. Interestingly, tau aggregates in AD and CTE, containing both 3R and 4R isoforms, were unable to robustly infect either 3R- or 4R-expressing cells. However, AD and CTE prions were able to replicate in HEK293T cells expressing both 3R and 4R tau. Unexpectedly, increasing the level of 4R isoform expression alone supported the propagation of both AD and CTE prions. These results allowed us to determine the levels of tau prions in AD and CTE brain extracts. "
2016-12-01,"Blood protein analysis of total tau (t-tau) may be a practical screening biomarker for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative tauopathy associated with repetitive head impact (RHI) exposure. We examined plasma t-tau in symptomatic former National Football League (NFL) players compared with controls and the relationship between RHI exposure and later-life plasma t-tau. Ninety-six former NFL players (age 40-69) and 25 same-age controls underwent blood draw to determine plasma t-tau levels. The cumulative head impact index (CHII) quantified RHI exposure. Subjects completed measures of clinical function. A higher CHII predicted greater plasma t-tau in the former NFL players ( Greater RHI exposure predicted higher later-life plasma t-tau concentrations, and further study on plasma t-tau as a candidate screening biomarker for CTE is warranted.

2016-12-01,"One of the two common hallmark lesions of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains is neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which are composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein (p-tau). NFTs are also a defining feature of other neurodegenerative disorders and have recently been identified in the brains of patients suffering from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, NFTs are not normally observed in traumatic brain injury (TBI) until months or years after injury. This raises the question of whether NFTs are a cause or a consequence of long-term neurodegeneration following TBI. Two conformations of phosphorylated tau,  "
2016-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been described mainly in professional athletes and military personnel and is characterized by deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau at the depths of cortical sulci and around blood vessels. To assess CTE-like changes in a routine neuropathology service, we prospectively examined 111 brains (age 18-60 years). The presence of tau-immunoreactive deposits was staged using guidelines described by others and was correlated with the medical history. 72/111 cases were negative for CTE-like changes; 34/111 were CTE stage <1; 3/111 were CTE stage 1; and 2/111 were CTE stage 2. The combined history of head injury and alcohol and/or drug abuse was a significant predictor of any CTE-like changes. Age was also a significant predictor; most with any CTE-like changes were >40 years old. CTE-like changes were not identified at sites of contusion. Among a separate group studied retrospectively, we identified 4 cases that met full criteria for CTE. We conclude that CTE-like findings are not confined to professional athletes; the risk factors of head injury and substance abuse are similar in the routine population. However, the significance of very small hyperphosphorylated tau deposits remains to be determined. In addition, the absence of typical CTE-like deposits near contusion sites keeps open the question of pathogenesis. "
2016-12-01,"This AANS presidential address focuses on enduring values of the neurosurgical profession that transcend the current political climate. The address was delivered by Dr. Batjer during a US presidential election year, but the authors have intentionally avoided discussing the current chaos of the American health care system in the knowledge that many pressing issues will change depending on the outcome of the 2016 elections. Instead, they have chosen to focus on clarifying what neurosurgeons, and the American Association of Neurological Surgeons, in particular, stand for; identifying important challenges to these fundamental principles and values; and proposing specific actions to address these challenges. The authors cite ""de-professionalism"" and commoditization of medicine as foremost among the threats that confront medicine and surgery today and suggest concrete action that can be taken to reverse these trends as well as steps that can be taken to address other significant challenges. They emphasize the importance of embracing exceptionalism and never compromising the standards that have characterized the profession of neurosurgery since its inception. "
2016-12-01,"Although traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a major public health concern for decades, the pathophysiological mechanism of TBI is not clearly understood, and an effective medical treatment of TBI is not available at present. Of particular concern is sustained TBI, which has a strong tendency to take a deteriorating neurodegenerative course into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and dementia, including Alzheimer's disease. Tauopathy and beta amyloid (Aβ) plaques are known to be the key pathological markers of TBI, which contribute to the progressive deterioration associated with TBI such as CTE and Alzheimer's disease. The multiple lines of evidence strongly suggest that the inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a potential target in the treatment of TBI. GSK-3 constitutively inhibits neuroprotective processes and promotes apoptosis. After TBI, GSK-3 is inhibited through the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and canonical Wnt signaling pathways as an innate neuroprotective mechanism against TBI. GSK-3 inhibition via GSK-3 inhibitors and drugs activating RTK or Wnt signaling is likely to reinforce the innate neuroprotective mechanism. GSK-3 inhibition studies using rodent TBI models demonstrate that GSK-3 inhibition produces diverse neuroprotective actions such as reducing the size of the traumatic injury, tauopathy, Aβ accumulation, and neuronal death, by releasing and activating neuroprotective substrates from GSK-3 inhibition. These effects are correlated with reduced TBI-induced behavioral and cognitive symptoms. Here, we review studies on the therapeutic effects of GSK-3 inhibition in TBI rodent models, and critically discuss the issues that these studies address. "
2016-12-01,"Memory loss can be due to a wide variety of causes. We provide new information about the biology of common genetic and acquired causes of memory loss in older adults. New data are available about the genetics of Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and frontotemporal dementia. Amyloid PET, FDG-PET, and MRI have improved our understanding of how mild cognitive impairment evolves to AD. Several studies have shown links between concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Healthy eating and regular exercise have been demonstrated to slow cognitive decline in older adults. Randomized trials continue to show benefits for cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine in patients with AD and DLB. New causes of memory loss are still being identified. More sophisticated diagnostic tools have improved our ability to make earlier diagnoses in older adults with memory loss. "
2016-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neuropathologically defined disease reportedly linked to a history of repetitive brain trauma. As such, retired collision sport athletes are likely at heightened risk for developing CTE. Researchers have described distinct pathological features of CTE as well a wide range of clinical symptom presentations, recently termed traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES). These clinical symptoms are highly variable, non-specific to individuals described as having CTE pathology in case reports, and are often associated with many other factors. This review describes the cognitive, emotional, and behavioral changes associated with 1) developmental and demographic factors, 2) neurodevelopmental disorders, 3) normal aging, 4) adjusting to retirement, 5) drug and alcohol abuse, 6) surgeries and anesthesia, and 7) sleep difficulties, as well as the relationship between these factors and risk for developing dementia-related neurodegenerative disease. We discuss why some professional athletes may be particularly susceptible to many of these effects and the importance of choosing appropriate controls groups when designing research protocols. We conclude that these factors should be considered as modifiers predominantly of the clinical outcomes associated with repetitive brain trauma within a broader biopsychosocial framework when interpreting and attributing symptom development, though also note potential effects on neuropathological outcomes. Importantly, this could have significant treatment implications for improving quality of life. "
2016-11-01,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are clinically grouped by severity: mild, moderate and severe. Mild TBI (the least severe form) is synonymous with concussion and is typically caused by blunt non-penetrating head trauma. The trauma causes stretching and tearing of axons, which leads to diffuse axonal injury - the best-studied pathogenetic mechanism of this disorder. However, mild TBI is defined on clinical grounds and no well-validated imaging or fluid biomarkers to determine the presence of neuronal damage in patients with mild TBI is available. Most patients with mild TBI will recover quickly, but others report persistent symptoms, called post-concussive syndrome, the underlying pathophysiology of which is largely unknown. Repeated concussive and subconcussive head injuries have been linked to the neurodegenerative condition chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has been reported post-mortem in contact sports athletes and soldiers exposed to blasts. Insights from severe injuries and CTE plausibly shed light on the underlying cellular and molecular processes involved in mild TBI. MRI techniques and blood tests for axonal proteins to identify and grade axonal injury, in addition to PET for tau pathology, show promise as tools to explore CTE pathophysiology in longitudinal clinical studies, and might be developed into diagnostic tools for CTE. Given that CTE is attributed to repeated head trauma, prevention might be possible through rule changes by sports organizations and legislators. "
2016-11-01,"Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI), resulting from insults caused by an external mechanical force that disrupts normal brain function, has been linked to the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer disease; however, neither the severity nor frequency of head injury required to trigger adverse behavioral outcomes is well understood. In this study, the administration of 30 head impacts using two different weights to lightly anesthetized, completely unrestrained mice established a paradigm that simulates the highly repetitive nature of sports- and military-related head injury. As the number of head impacts increases, the time to recover consciousness diminishes; however, both the sensorimotor function and behavioral outcomes of impacted mice evolve during the ensuing weeks. Postmortem analyses reveal robust Alzheimer disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy-like conditions that manifest in a singular manner throughout the white matter concomitant with evidence of chronic oligodendrogenesis. Our data suggest that latency to recover the righting reflex may be an inadequate measure of injury severity and imply that exposure to repeated head impacts may mask the severity of an underlying and developing neuropathologic condition that does not manifest itself until long after head collisions cease. In addition, our data indicate that there is a cumulative and dose-dependent effect of repetitive head impacts that induces the neurobehavioral and neuropathologic outcomes seen in humans with a history of rmTBI.

2016-11-01,"Whereas the cerebral cortex has long been regarded by neuroscientists as the major locus of cognitive function, the white matter of the brain is increasingly recognized as equally critical for cognition. White matter comprises half of the brain, has expanded more than gray matter in evolution, and forms an indispensable component of distributed neural networks that subserve neurobehavioral operations. White matter tracts mediate the essential connectivity by which human behavior is organized, working in concert with gray matter to enable the extraordinary repertoire of human cognitive capacities. In this review, we present evidence from behavioral neurology that white matter lesions regularly disturb cognition, consider the role of white matter in the physiology of distributed neural networks, develop the hypothesis that white matter dysfunction is relevant to neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and the newly described entity chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and discuss emerging concepts regarding the prevention and treatment of cognitive dysfunction associated with white matter disorders. Investigation of the role of white matter in cognition has yielded many valuable insights and promises to expand understanding of normal brain structure and function, improve the treatment of many neurobehavioral disorders, and disclose new opportunities for research on many challenging problems facing medicine and society.

2016-11-01,"OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to determine the demographics and predictors of postconcussion syndrome (PCS) in a large series of patients using a novel definition of PCS. METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective cohort study of 284 consecutive concussed patients, 221 of whom had PCS on the basis of at least 3 symptoms persisting at least 1 month. This definition of PCS was uniformly employed and is unique in accepting an expanded list of symptoms, in shortening the postconcussion interval to 1 month from 3 months, and in excluding those with focal injuries such as hemorrhages and contusions. RESULTS The 221 cases showed considerable heterogeneity in clinical features of PCS. They averaged 3.3 concussions, with a range of 0 to 12 or more concussions, and 62.4% occurred during sports and recreation. The median duration of PCS was 7 months at the time of examination, with 11.8% lasting more than 2 years, and 23.1% with PCS had only 1 concussion. The average patient age was 27 years (range 10-74 years). The average number of persistent symptoms was 8.1; 26.2% had a previous psychiatric condition, attention-deficit disorder/attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, a learning disability, or previous migraine headaches. The prevalence of arachnoid cysts and Chiari malformation in PCS exceeded the general population. Additionally, involvement in litigation, presence of extracranial injuries, amnesia and/or loss of consciousness, and female sex were predictive of reporting a high number of symptoms. A prior history of psychiatric conditions or migraines, cause of injury, number of previous concussions, and age did not significantly predict symptom number. Only the number of symptoms reported predicted the duration of PCS. To predict the number of symptoms for those who fulfilled PCS criteria according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV), the number of previous concussions was significant. CONCLUSIONS PCS is commonly associated with multiple concussions, but 23.1% in the present series occurred after only 1 concussion. Most patients with PCS had multiple symptoms persisting for months or years. The median duration of PCS was 7 months, with a range up to 26 years. In only 11.3%, the PCS had ended at the time of consultation. Not all predictors commonly cited in the literature align with the findings in this study. This is likely due to differences in the definitions of PCS used in research. These results suggest that the use of ICD-10 and DSM-IV to diagnose PCS may be biased toward those who are vulnerable to concussions or with more severe forms of PCS. It is thus important to redefine PCS based on evidence-based medicine. "
2016-11-01,"Evidence is accumulating that repeated mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) incidents can lead to persistent, long-term debilitating symptoms and in some cases a progressive neurodegenerative condition referred to as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, to our knowledge, there are no objective tools to examine to which degree persistent symptoms after mTBI are caused by neuronal injury. To determine whether persistent symptoms after mTBI are associated with brain injury as evaluated by cerebrospinal fluid biochemical markers for axonal damage and other aspects of central nervous system injury. A multicenter cross-sectional study involving professional Swedish ice hockey players who have had repeated mTBI, had postconcussion symptoms for more than 3 months, and fulfilled the criteria for postconcussion syndrome (PCS) according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) matched with neurologically healthy control individuals. The participants were enrolled between January 2014 and February 2016. The players were also assessed with Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire and magnetic resonance imaging. Neurofilament light protein, total tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, amyloid β, phosphorylated tau, and neurogranin concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 31 participants (16 men with PCS; median age, 31 years; range, 22-53 years; and 15 control individuals [11 men and 4 women]; median age, 25 years; range, 21-35 years) were assessed. Of 16 players with PCS, 9 had PCS symptoms for more than 1 year, while the remaining 7 returned to play within a year. Neurofilament light proteins were significantly increased in players with PCS for more than 1 year (median, 410 pg/mL; range, 230-1440 pg/mL) compared with players whose PCS resolved within 1 year (median, 210 pg/mL; range, 140-460 pg/mL) as well as control individuals (median 238 pg/mL, range 128-526 pg/mL; P = .04 and P = .02, respectively). Furthermore, neurofilament light protein concentrations correlated with Rivermead Post Concussion Symptoms Questionnaire scores and lifetime concussion events (ρ = 0.58, P = .02 and ρ = 0.52, P = .04, respectively). Overall, players with PCS had significantly lower cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β levels compared with control individuals (median, 1094 pg/mL; range, 845-1305 pg/mL; P = .05). Increased cerebrospinal fluid neurofilament light proteins and reduced amyloid β were observed in patients with PCS, suggestive of axonal white matter injury and amyloid deposition. Measurement of these biomarkers may be an objective tool to assess the degree of central nervous system injury in individuals with PCS and to distinguish individuals who are at risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

2016-11-01,"Alzheimer disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) share a common neuropathologic signature-neurofibrillary tangles made of phosphorylated tau-but do not have the same pathogenesis or symptoms. Although whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) could cause AD has not been established, CTE is shown to be associated with TBI. Until recently, whether and how TBI leads to tau-mediated neurodegeneration was unknown. The unique prolyl isomerase Pin1 protects against the development of tau-mediated neurodegeneration in AD by converting the phosphorylated Thr231-Pro motif in tau (ptau) from the pathogenic cis conformation to the physiologic trans conformation, thereby restoring ptau function. The recent development of antibodies able to distinguish and eliminate both conformations specifically has led to the discovery of cis-ptau as a precursor of tau-induced pathologic change and an early driver of neurodegeneration that directly links TBI to CTE and possibly to AD. Within hours of TBI in mice or neuronal stress in vitro, neurons prominently produce cis-ptau, which causes and spreads cis-ptau pathologic changes, termed cistauosis. Cistauosis eventually leads to widespread tau-mediated neurodegeneration and brain atrophy. Cistauosis is effectively blocked by the cis-ptau antibody, which targets intracellular cis-ptau for proteasome-mediated degradation and prevents extracellular cis-ptau from spreading to other neurons. Treating TBI mice with cis-ptau antibody not only blocks early cistauosis but also prevents development and spreading of tau-mediated neurodegeneration and brain atrophy and restores brain histopathologic features and functional outcomes. Thus, cistauosis is a common early disease mechanism for AD, TBI, and CTE, and cis-ptau and its antibody may be useful for early diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of these devastating diseases. "
2016-10-01,"The chronic effects of repetitive head impacts (RHI) on the development of neuroinflammation and its relationship to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are unknown. Here we set out to determine the relationship between RHI exposure, neuroinflammation, and the development of hyperphosphorylated tau (ptau) pathology and dementia risk in CTE. We studied a cohort of 66 deceased American football athletes from the Boston University-Veteran's Affairs-Concussion Legacy Foundation Brain Bank as well as 16 non-athlete controls. Subjects with a neurodegenerative disease other than CTE were excluded. Counts of total and activated microglia, astrocytes, and ptau pathology were performed in the dorsolateral frontal cortex (DLF). Binary logistic and simultaneous equation regression models were used to test associations between RHI exposure, microglia, ptau pathology, and dementia. Duration of RHI exposure and the development and severity of CTE were associated with reactive microglial morphology and increased numbers of CD68 immunoreactive microglia in the DLF. A simultaneous equation regression model demonstrated that RHI exposure had a significant direct effect on CD68 cell density (p < 0.0001) and ptau pathology (p < 0.0001) independent of age at death. The effect of RHI on ptau pathology was partially mediated through increased CD68 positive cell density. A binary logistic regression demonstrated that a diagnosis of dementia was significantly predicted by CD68 cell density (OR = 1.010, p = 0.011) independent of age (OR = 1.055, p = 0.007), but this effect disappeared when ptau pathology was included in the model. In conclusion, RHI is associated with chronic activation of microglia, which may partially mediate the effect of RHI on the development of ptau pathology and dementia in CTE. Inflammatory molecules may be important diagnostic or predictive biomarkers as well as promising therapeutic targets in CTE. "
2016-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability around the world. The lack of validated biomarkers for TBI is a major impediment to developing effective therapies and improving clinical practice, as well as stimulating much work in this area. In this review, we focus on different settings of TBI management where blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers could be utilized for predicting clinically-relevant consequences and guiding management decisions. Requirements that the biomarker must fulfill differ based on the intended context of use (CoU). Specifically, we focus on fluid biomarkers in order to: (1) identify patients who may require acute neuroimaging (cranial computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (2) select patients at risk for secondary brain injury processes; (3) aid in counseling patients about their symptoms at discharge; (4) identify patients at risk for developing postconcussive syndrome (PCS), posttraumatic epilepsy (PTE) or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); (5) predict outcomes with respect to poor or good recovery; (6) inform counseling as to return to work (RTW) or to play. Despite significant advances already made from biomarker-based studies of TBI, there is an immediate need for further large-scale studies focused on identifying and innovating sensitive and reliable TBI biomarkers. These studies should be designed with the intended CoU in mind. "
2016-10-01,"Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) transport across the central nervous system (CNS) is no longer believed to be on the conventional lines. The Virchow-Robin space (VRS) that facilitates CSF transport from the basal cisterns into the brain interstitial fluid (ISF) has gained interest in a whole new array of studies. Moreover, new line of evidence suggests that VRS may be involved in different pathological mechanisms of brain diseases. Here, we review emerging studies proving the feasible role of VRS in sleep, Alzheimer's disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we have outlined the possible role of VRS in different pathological conditions. The new insights into the physiology of the CSF circulation may have important clinical relevance for understanding the mechanisms underlying brain pathologies and their cure. "
2016-10-01,"Here a case is presented of a 51-year-old former high school football player with multiple concussions, including one episode with loss of consciousness. The patient experienced 6 years of cognitive and mood decline, and his wife corroborated increasing memory loss, attentional difficulties, and depressed mood without suicidal ideation. He had been unable to maintain full-time employment because of progressive decline. Based on his presentation, he had been previously diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder, type II. Neuropsychological tests indicated domain-specific cognitive impairment, and longitudinal volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed progressive brainstem, diencephalic, and frontal lobe atrophy. This regional volume loss correlated with the increased signal seen on tau and amyloid imaging (FDDNP-PET scan) of a separate case of suspected chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Visual assessment of the MRI also showed evidence of old petechial hemorrhages in the frontal and temporal-parietal lobe white matter. This case raises the possibility of distinct quantitative and visual brain MRI findings in suspected CTE. "

2016-10-01,"There is current disagreement in the scientific literature about the relationship between playing football and suicide risk, particularly among professional players in the National Football League (NFL). While some research indicates players are at high risk of football-related concussions, which may lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy and suicide, other research finds such a connection to be speculative and unsupported by methodologically sound research. To compare the suicide mortality of a cohort of NFL players to what would be expected in the general population of the United States. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. A cohort of 3439 NFL players with at least 5 credited playing seasons between 1959 and 1988 was assembled for statistical analysis. The vital status for this cohort was updated through 2013. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), the ratio of observed deaths to expected deaths, and 95% CIs were computed for the cohort; 95% CIs that excluded unity were considered statistically significant. For internal comparison purposes, standardized rate ratios were calculated to compare mortality results between players stratified into speed and nonspeed position types. Suicide among this cohort of professional football players was significantly less than would be expected in comparison with the United States population (SMR = 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24-0.82). There were no significant differences in suicide mortality between speed and nonspeed position players. There is no indication of elevated suicide risk in this cohort of professional football players with 5 or more credited seasons of play. Because of the unique nature of this cohort, these study results may not be applicable to professional football players who played fewer than 5 years or to college or high school players. "
2016-10-01,"Retrospective assessment of post-traumatic amnesia (PTA) must take into account factors other than traumatic brain injury (TBI) which may impact on memory both at the time of injury and subsequent to the injury. These include analgesics, anaesthesia required for surgery, and the development of acute or post-traumatic stress disorder. This is relevant in clinical and medicolegal settings. Repeated assessments of the post-injury state, involving tests for continuing amnesia, risk promoting recall of events suggested by the examiner, or generating confabulations. The PTA syndrome affects the categorical autobiographical memory, and is accompanied by confusion as an essential component; this should be suspected from the initial or early Glasgow Coma Scale score (13-14/15) if not directly recorded by clinical staff. PTA by itself is only one of several indices of severity of TBI. The nature of the head injury, including observers' accounts, clinical and neuroimaging data, the possible role of other external injuries, blood loss, acute stress disorder and the potential for hypoxic brain injury, must be taken into account as well as concomitant alcohol or substance abuse, and systemic shock. A plausible mechanism for a TBI must be demonstrable, and other causes of amnesia excluded. "
2016-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder associated with repetitive traumatic brain injury. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a Parkinsonian disorder that can result in repetitive falls with associated head trauma. We hypothesized that patients with neurodegenerative disorders like MSA could develop CTE pathology. Therefore, we assessed CTE pathology in 139 MSA cases in our brain bank. Sections from convexity cerebral cortices were screened by immunohistochemistry with anti-phospho-tau antibody. For cases with suggestive CTE pathology, further sections of basal forebrain and hippocampus were immunostained. Consensus criteria were used to make the diagnosis of CTE and aging-related tau astrogliopathy (ARTAG) was differentiated from CTE pathology. Pertinent clinical information was derived from the available records and online searches. Of the 139 MSA cases, 8 (6%) had CTE pathology and 10 (8%) had ARTAG pathology. All 8 cases with CTE were male and 4 of them had a documented history of contact sports. The median age at death in MSA with CTE was younger than in MSA without CTE or MSA with ARTAG (60, 67, and 74 years, respectively; p = 0.002). Even without a known history of contact sports or head trauma, a small subset of cases with MSA had CTE pathology. "
2016-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease occurring most commonly in athletes and is caused by repeated concussive or subconcussive blows to the head. The main purpose of this review is to evaluate the published literature on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in athletes participating in high-impact sports. In particular, we highlight the significance of concussive and subconcussive impacts in multiple sports, elucidate the differences between clinical/pathological features of CTE and related neurodegenerative diseases, and provide an explanation for the variation in clinical presentation between athletes of different sports. A review targeting relevant publications to CTE was performed. The PubMed/MEDLINE index was searched for keywords such as ""chronic traumatic encephalopathy,"" ""repetitive traumatic brain injury,"" ""mild traumatic brain injury,"" and ""concussion"" from year 1924 through March 1, 2016. A consensus panel's recent identification of a pathognomonic pathology in CTE, characterized by an irregular distribution of phosphorylated tau deposits, is an important step in developing consensus diagnostic criteria and clinicopathological studies. After review of major clinical studies, evidence suggests that there are clear differences in neuropathological features, clinical progression, and manifestation of symptoms between CTE and other neurodegenerative diseases. The literature suggests boxers tend to have more severe symptoms than other athletes due to more frequent rotational and shearing impacts. Data regarding genetic predispositions of CTE have been inconsistent in part due to low subject populations. Positron emission tomography imaging involving tau-binding ligands has recently proven effective in differentiating CTE from control groups and other neurodegenerative diseases. Further longitudinal studies should be conducted to correlate the number of suffered concussive/subconcussive forces to the likelihood of developing chronic traumatic brain injury symptoms. Research striving for a reliable antemortem CTE diagnosis would be immensely beneficial, leading to more accurate estimates of prevalence, allowing clinicians to assess future risk of athletes' continued participation in sports, and enabling clinicians to make appropriate preventive recommendations. "
2016-10-01,"Diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), also known as concussion, remain a major unmet clinical need. Moderate to severe TBI can be diagnosed definitively by clinical assessment and standard neuroimaging techniques that detect the gross damage to the brain parenchyma. Diagnostic tools for mild TBI are lacking and, currently, the diagnosis has to be made on clinical grounds alone, because most patients show no gross pathological changes on CT. Most patients with mild TBI recover quickly, but about 15% develop an ill-defined condition called postconcussive syndrome (PCS). Repeated concussions have been associated with a chronic neurodegenerative disorder called chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which can only currently be diagnosed post mortem. Fluid biomarkers are needed to better define and detect mild TBI and related conditions. Here, we review the literature on fluid biomarkers for neuronal, axonal, oligodendrocytic, astroglial and blood-brain barrier injury, as well as markers for neuroinflammation and metabolic dysregulation, in the context of mild TBI, PCS and CTE. We also discuss technical and standardization issues and potential pathways to advance the most promising biomarker candidates into clinical laboratory practice. "

CTE can only be diagnosed by postmortem neuropathologic examination of brain tissue. CTE is a unique disorder with a pathognomonic lesion that can be reliably distinguished from other neurodegenerative diseases. CTE is associated with violent behaviors, explosivity, loss of control, depression, suicide, memory loss and cognitive changes. There is increasing evidence that CTE affects amateur athletes as well as professional athletes and military veterans. CTE has become a major public health concern.  "

2016-09-01,"SEE BERNASCONI DOI101093/AWW202 FOR A SCIENTIFIC COMMENTARY ON THIS ARTICLE: Temporal lobe epilepsy, the most prevalent form of chronic focal epilepsy, is associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment but the responsible underlying pathological mechanisms are unknown. Tau, the microtubule-associated protein, is a hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We hypothesized that hyperphosphorylated tau pathology is associated with cognitive decline in temporal lobe epilepsy and explored this through clinico-pathological study. We first performed pathological examination on tissue from 33 patients who had undergone temporal lobe resection between ages 50 and 65 years to treat drug-refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. We identified hyperphosphorylated tau protein using AT8 immunohistochemistry and compared this distribution to Braak patterns of Alzheimer's disease and patterns of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We quantified tau pathology using a modified tau score created specifically for analysis of temporal lobectomy tissue and the Braak staging, which was limited without extra-temporal brain areas available. Next, we correlated tau pathology with pre- and postoperative cognitive test scores and clinical risk factors including age at time of surgery, duration of epilepsy, history of secondary generalized seizures, history of head injury, handedness and side of surgery. Thirty-one of 33 cases (94%) showed hyperphosphorylated tau pathology in the form of neuropil threads and neurofibrillary tangles and pre-tangles. Braak stage analysis showed 12% of our epilepsy cohort had a Braak staging III-IV compared to an age-matched non-epilepsy control group from the literature (8%). We identified a mixture of tau pathology patterns characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We also found unusual patterns of subpial tau deposition, sparing of the hippocampus and co-localization with mossy fibre sprouting, a feature of temporal lobe epilepsy. We demonstrated that the more extensive the tau pathology, the greater the decline in verbal learning (Spearman correlation, r = -0.63), recall (r = -0.44) and graded naming test scores (r = -0.50) over 1-year post-temporal lobe resection (P < 0.05). This relationship with tau burden was also present when examining decline in verbal learning from 3 months to 1 year post-resection (r = -0.54). We found an association between modified tau score and history of secondary generalized seizures (likelihood-ratio χ(2), P < 0.05) however there was no clear relationship between tau pathology and other clinical risk factors assessed. Our findings suggest an epilepsy-related tauopathy in temporal lobe epilepsy, which contributes to accelerated cognitive decline and has diagnostic and treatment implications. "
2016-09-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has come to the forefront of both the scientific and popular culture. Specifically, sports-related concussions or mild TBI (mTBI) has become the center of scientific scrutiny with a large amount of research focusing on the long-term sequela of this type of injury. As the populace continues to age, the impact of TBI on the aging brain will become clearer. Currently, reports have come to light that link TBI to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, as well as certain psychiatric diseases. Whether these associations are causations, however, is yet to be determined. Other long-term sequelae, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), appear to be associated with repetitive injuries. Going forward, as we gain better understanding of the pathophysiological process involved in TBI and subclinical head traumas, and individual traits that influence susceptibility to neurocognitive diseases, a clearer, more comprehensive understanding of the connection between brain injury and resultant disease processes in the aging brain will become evident.

2016-09-01,"Head injuries are a particular concern in Hawai'i given the large military population, the presence of many land and water sports such as football and surfing, and the lenient helmet laws for motorcycle and bicycle riders. Physical, psychological, and cognitive symptoms from single or repeated concussions can affect an individual's reentry to society and activity. Current literature indicates that repeated head injuries are associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) which is thought to lead to dementia. This paper reviews literature discussing causes of concussion including its incidence and prevalence in Hawai'i. Furthermore, the neurophysiological and neurobiological etiologies are discussed followed by an overview of methods for identification and management of concussion. The paper serves as information for professionals in the community such as educators, military personnel, and healthcare workers to identify risks of concussion, management of symptoms, and to connect with resources and programs available in Hawai'i.

2016-09-01,"Mild traumatic brain injuries may result in cumulative brain damage and neurodegenerative disease. To date, there is no pharmaceutical intervention known to prevent these consequences. Hyperphosphorylated tau has been associated in this process, and protein phosphatase 2A 55 kDa regulatory B subunit (PP2A/PR55) - the major tau phosphatase - is decreased after a brain insult. Sodium selenate up-regulates PP2A/PR55 and dephosphorylates tau, and may hold promise as a treatment in the mild brain injury setting. Here we investigated sodium selenate treatment in rats given repeated mild traumatic brain injuries. Rats were given three mild fluid percussion injuries or three sham-injuries, and treated with sodium selenate (1 mg/kg/day) or saline-vehicle for three months before undergoing behavioral testing, MRI, and post-mortem analysis of brain tissue. Repeated mild traumatic brain injuries increased the phosphorylation of tau and decreased PP2A/PR55, whilst inducing brain atrophy and cognitive and sensorimotor deficits. Sodium selenate treatment increased PP2A/PR55, and decreased tau phosphorylation, brain damage, and cognitive and motor impairments in rats given repeated mild traumatic brain injuries. Our findings implicate PP2A/PR55 and tau as important mechanisms in the pathophysiological aftermath of repeated mild brain traumas, and support sodium selenate as a novel and translatable treatment for these common injuries.

2016-09-01,"Professional boxing can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a variant of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Its occurrence in amateur boxers is a matter of debate since amateur boxing is considered to be less harmful due to more strict regulations. However, several studies using different methodological approaches have revealed subtle signs of TBI even in amateurs. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is sensitive to microscopic white matter changes and has been proven useful in TBI when routine MR imaging often is unrevealing. DTI, with tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) together with neuropsychological examination of executive functions and memory, was used to investigate a collective of 31 male amateur boxers and 31 age-matched controls as well as a subgroup of 19 individuals, respectively, who were additionally matched for intellectual performance (IQ). All participants had normal findings in neurological examination and conventional MR. Amateur boxers did not show deficits in neuropsychological tests when their IQ was taken into account. Fractional anisotropy was significantly reduced, while diffusivity measures were increased along central white matter tracts in the boxers group. These changes were in part associated with the number of fights. TBSS revealed widespread white matter disturbance partially related to the individual fighting history in amateur boxers. These findings closely resemble those in patients with accidental TBI and indicate similar histological changes in amateur boxers. "
2016-09-01,"Mounting research in the field of sports concussion biomarkers has led to a greater understanding of the effects of brain injury from sports. A recent systematic review of clinical studies examining biomarkers of brain injury following sports-related concussion established that almost all studies have been published either in or after the year 2000. In an effort to prevent chronic traumatic encephalopathy and long-term consequences of concussion, early diagnostic and prognostic tools are becoming increasingly important; particularly in sports and in military personnel, where concussions are common occurrences. Early and tailored management of athletes following a concussion with biomarkers could provide them with the best opportunity to avoid further injury. Should blood-based biomarkers for concussion be validated and become widely available, they could have many roles. For instance, a point-of-care test could be used on the field by trained sport medicine professionals to help detect a concussion. In the clinic or hospital setting, it could be used by clinicians to determine the severity of concussion and be used to screen players for neuroimaging (computed tomography and/or magnetic resonance imaging) and further neuropsychological testing. Furthermore, biomarkers could have a role in monitoring progression of injury and recovery and in managing patients at high risk of repeated injury by being incorporated into guidelines for return to duty, work, or sports activities. There may even be a role for biomarkers as surrogate measures of efficacy in the assessment of new treatments and therapies for concussion.  "
2016-08-01,"A history of concussion, particularly repeated injury, has been linked to an increased risk for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is characterized by abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and deficits in learning and memory. As yet the mechanisms associated with the development of CTE are unknown. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to develop and characterize a novel model of repetitive mTBI that accurately reproduces the key short and long-term functional and histopathological features seen clinically. Forty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to receive 0, 1 or 3x mTBI spaced five days apart using a modified version of the Marmarou impact-acceleration diffuse-TBI model to deliver 110G of linear force. Functional outcomes were assessed six and twelve weeks post-injury, with histopathology assessed twenty-four hours and twelve weeks post-injury. Repetitive mTBI resulted in mild spatial and recognition memory deficits as reflected by increased escape latency on the Barnes maze and decreased time spent in the novel arm of the Y maze. There was a trend towards increased anxiety-like behavior, with decreased time spent in the inner portion of the open field. At 24 hours and 12 weeks post injury, repetitive mTBI animals showed increased tau phosphorylation and microglial activation within the cortex. Increases in APP immunoreactivity were observed in repetitive mTBI animals at 12 weeks indicating long-term changes in axonal integrity. This novel model of repetitive mTBI with its persistent cognitive deficits, neuroinflammation, axonal injury and tau hyperphosphorylation, thus represents a clinically relevant experimental approach to further explore the underlying pathogenesis of CTE.

2016-08-01,"A derangement of brain wound healing may cause some cases of Alzheimer's disease. Wound healing, a highly complex process, has four stages: hemostasis, inflammation, repair, and remodeling. Hemostasis and the initial phases of inflammation in brain tissue are typical of all vascularized tissue, such as skin. However, distinct differences arise in brain tissue during the later stages of inflammation, repair, and remodeling, and closely parallel the changes of Alzheimer's disease. Our hypothesis -- Alzheimer's disease is brain wound healing gone awry at least in some cases -- could be tested by measuring progression with biomarkers for the four stages of wound healing in humans or appropriate animal models. Autopsy studies might be done. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy might also result from the brain wound healing process. "

Without neuropathologic confirmation, a clinical diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy cannot be made with a high degree of confidence. Sport-related headaches are challenging in a return-to-play context, because it is often unclear whether an athlete has an exacerbation of a primary headache disorder, has new-onset headache unrelated to trauma, or is in the recovery phase after concussion. Regular physical exercise may prove beneficial to multiple neurologic disease states. "

We report clinicopathological correlations in an 83-year-old retired center-back soccer player, with no history of concussion, manifesting typical Alzheimer-type dementia. Examination revealed mixed pathology including widespread CTE, moderate Alzheimer's disease, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43 proteinopathy. This case adds to a few CTE cases described in soccer players. Furthermore, it corroborates that CTE may present clinically as typical Alzheimer-type dementia. Further studies investigating the extent to which soccer is a risk for CTE are needed. "
2016-07-01,"Three scaffolds with inhibitory activity against the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) family of chaperones have been found to enhance the degradation of the microtubule associated protein tau in cells, neurons, and brain tissue. This is important because tau accumulation is linked to neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Here, we expanded upon this study to investigate the anti-tau efficacy of additional scaffolds with Hsp70 inhibitory activity. Five of the nine scaffolds tested lowered tau levels, with the rhodacyanine and phenothiazine scaffolds exhibiting the highest potency as previously described. Because phenothiazines also inhibit tau aggregation in vitro, we suspected that this activity might be a more accurate predictor of tau lowering. Interestingly, the rhodacyanines did inhibit in vitro tau aggregation to a similar degree as phenothiazines, correlating well with tau-lowering efficacy in cells and ex vivo slices. Moreover, other Hsp70 inhibitor scaffolds with weaker tau-lowering activity in cells inhibited tau aggregation in vitro, albeit at lower potencies. When we tested six well-characterized tau aggregation inhibitors, we determined that this mechanism of action was not a better predictor of tau-lowering than Hsp70 inhibition. Instead, we found that compounds possessing both activities were the most effective at promoting tau clearance. Moreover, cytotoxicity and PAINS activity are critical factors that can lead to false-positive lead identification. Strategies designed around these principles will likely yield more efficacious tau-lowering compounds. "
2016-07-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease, which is associated with mild repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI). This long-term and progressive symptom due to TBI was initially called punch-drunk syndrome or dementia pugilistica, since it was believed to be associated with boxing. However, serial neuropathological studies of mild repetitive TBI in the last decade have revealed that CTE occurs not only in boxers but also in a wider population including American football players, wrestlers, and military personnel. CTE has gained large public interest owing to dramatic cases involving retired professional athletes wherein serious behavioral problems and tragic incidents were reported. Unlike mild repetitive TBI, a single episode of severe TBI can cause another type of late-onset neuropsychiatric disease including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several epidemiological studies have shown that a single episode of severe TBI is one of the major risk factors of AD. Pathologically, both AD and CTE are characterized by abnormal accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins. However, recent neuropathological studies revealed that CTE demonstrates a unique pattern of tau pathology in neurons and astrocytes, and accumulation of other misfolded proteins such as TDP-43. Currently, no reliable biomarkers of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases following TBI are available, and a definitive diagnosis can be made only via postmortem neuropathological examination. Development in neuroimaging techniques such as tau and amyloid positron emission tomography imaging might not only enable early diagnosis of CTE, but also contribute to the interventions for prevention of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases following TBI. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms of neurodegeneration in the living brain of patients with TBI.  "
2016-07-01,"Exposure to repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is characterized by patchy deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates in neurons and astrocytes at the depths of cortical sulci. We developed an mTBI paradigm to explore effects of repetitive concussive-type injury over several months in mice with a human tau genetic background (hTau). Two injuries were induced in the hTau mice weekly over a period of 3 or 4 months and the effects were compared with those in noninjured sham animals. Behavioral and in vivo measures and detailed neuropathological assessments were conducted 6 months after the first injury. Our data confirm impairment in cerebral blood flow and white matter damage. This was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in total tau levels and mild increases in tau oligomers/conformers and pTau (Thr231) species in brain gray matter. There was no evidence of neurofibrillary/astroglial tangles, neuropil threads, or perivascular foci of tau immunoreactivity. There were neurobehavioral deficits (ie, disinhibition and impaired cognitive performance) in the mTBI animals. These data support the relevance of this new mTBI injury model for studying the consequences of chronic repetitive mTBI in humans, and the role of tau in TBI. "
2016-07-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative condition associated with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. In recent years, attention has focused on emerging evidence linking the development of CTE to concussive injuries in athletes and military personnel; however, the underlying molecular pathobiology of CTE remains unclear. Here, we provide evidence that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is disrupted in regions of dense perivascular p-Tau accumulation in a case of CTE. Immunoreactivity patterns of the BBB-associated tight junction components claudin-5 and zonula occludens-1 were markedly discontinuous or absent in regions of perivascular p-Tau deposition; there was also immunohistochemical evidence of a BBB in these foci. Because the patient was diagnosed premortem clinically as having progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), we also compromised that the CTE alterations appear to be distinct from those in the brain of a patient with PSP. This report represents the first description of BBB dysfunction in a pathologically proven CTE case and suggests a vascular component in the postconcussion cascade of events that may ultimately lead to development of a progressive degenerative disorder. BBB dysfunction may represent a correlate of neural dysfunction in live subjects suspected of being at risk for development of CTE. "
2016-07-01,"Bill Masterton is the only man to die of injuries sustained in a National Hockey League (NHL) game. He remains the last fatality in any professional team sport involving a direct in-game injury in North America. While Masterton was originally thought to have suffered a fatal brain injury while being checked on the ice, later analysis of the case revealed evidence of second-impact syndrome and the effects of prior concussions. Masterton's death sparked both an immediate debate in the NHL on whether helmets should be compulsory and the NHL's first vote on mandatory helmet use. Although the subject of mandated helmet use met with resistance in the 10 years after Masterton's death, especially from hockey owners and coaches, the NHL finally legislated helmet use by all players entering the league beginning in the 1979-1980 season. Several awards, including one recognizing the NHL player who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship, and dedication to hockey, have been created in memory of Masterton. However, his legacy extends far beyond the awards that bear his name. His death was the seminal event bringing head safety to the forefront of a game that was both unready and unwilling to accept change. An increase in mainstream media attention in recent years has led to unprecedented public awareness of brain injury and concussion in hockey and other sports. Advances in the diagnosis and treatment of head injury in sports have occurred recently, the impetus for which started over 45 years ago, when Bill Masterton died.  "

The assessment of tau deposition in the brain over time will allow a deeper understanding of the relationship between tau and other variables such as cognition, genotype, and neurodegeneration, as well as assessing the role tau plays in ageing.

The extent to which current clinical practice is consistent with guideline recommendations is unclear. At the collegiate level, there have been few examinations of concussion management practices and the extent to which meaningful differences across divisions of competition exist. The purposes of this study were to (1) examine current practices in concussion diagnosis and management at National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) member colleges, (2) explore the extent to which current practices reflect current recommendations for concussion diagnosis and management, and (3) determine whether there are differences in management patterns across divisions of competition. Descriptive epidemiology study. An electronic questionnaire was sent to sports medicine clinicians at all NCAA member colleges during September and October 2013. Clinicians were asked about baseline assessments, diagnosis and management practices, return-to-play protocols, the perceived prevalence of underdiagnosis, and basic demographic information. Approximately 30% (n = 866) of contacted clinicians, representing nearly 50% (n = 527) of NCAA member colleges, responded to the questionnaire. Preparticipation baseline examinations were administered at the majority of schools (95%), but most (87.5%) administered baseline assessments only to selected high-risk athletes. Computerized neurocognitive testing and balance assessments were most commonly used as preseason baseline and postinjury assessments. Multimodal examination in line with NCAA and other guidance was used only at a minority of institutions. Athletic trainers most commonly administered and interpreted the preseason baseline examination. Most clinicians reported that their institutions' practices were in line with NCAA guidelines during the first 24 hours of an athlete's concussion diagnosis, with exact percentages varying across measures. Differences across divisions of competition included shorter return-to-play time at Division I schools than Division III schools (9.13 vs 10.31 days, respectively) and more frequently referring concussed athletes to a physician within 24 hours of diagnosis at Division I schools. Concussion management at many colleges in the United States incorporates elements recommended by current guidelines; however, there is room to improve. Increasing the use of a multimodal baseline and postinjury examination will elevate the concussion care provided to college athletes and better align with best practice guidance. "
2016-06-01,"Concussion is a significant issue in medicine and the media today. With growing interest on the long-term effects of sports participation, it is important to understand what occurs in the brain after an impact of any degree. While some of the basic pathophysiology has been elucidated, much is still unknown about what happens in the brain after traumatic brain injury, particularly with milder injuries where no damage can be seen at the structural level on standard neuroimaging. Understanding the chain of events from a cellular level using studies investigating more severe injuries can help to drive research efforts in understanding the symptomatology that is seen in the acute phase after concussion, as well as point to mechanisms that may underlie persistent post-concussive symptoms. This review discusses the basic neuropathology that occurs after traumatic brain injury at the cellular level. We also present the pathology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and its similarities to other neurodegenerative diseases. We conclude with recent imaging and biomarker findings looking at changes that may occur after repeated subconcussive blows, which may help to guide efforts in understanding if cumulative subconcussive mechanical forces upon the brain are detrimental in the long term or if concussive symptoms mark the threshold for brain injury.

2016-06-01,"Aggregated tau protein is a major neuropathological substrate central to the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), frontotemporal dementia, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In AD, it has been shown that the density of hyperphosphorylated tau tangles correlates closely with neuronal dysfunction and cell death, unlike β-amyloid. Until now, diagnostic and pathologic information about tau deposition has only been available from invasive techniques such as brain biopsy or autopsy. The recent development of selective in-vivo tau PET imaging ligands including [(18)F]THK523, [(18)F]THK5117, [(18)F]THK5105 and [(18)F]THK5351, [(18)F]AV1451(T807) and [(11)C]PBB3 has provided information about the role of tau in the early phases of neurodegenerative diseases, and provided support for diagnosis, prognosis, and imaging biomarkers to track disease progression. Moreover, the spatial and longitudinal relationship of tau distribution compared with β - amyloid and other pathologies in these diseases can be mapped. In this review, we discuss the role of aggregated tau in tauopathies, the challenges posed in developing selective tau ligands as biomarkers, the state of development in tau tracers, and the new clinical information that has been uncovered, as well as the opportunities for improving diagnosis and designing clinical trials in the future.  "
2016-06-01,"Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) occurs as a result of mild and accumulative brain damage. A prototype of rTBI is chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is a degenerative disease that occurs in patients with histories of multiple concussions or head injuries. Boxers have been the most commonly studied patient group because they may experience thousands of subconcussive hits over the course of a career. This study examined the consequences of rTBI with structural brain imaging and biomolecular imaging and investigated whether the neuropsychological features of rTBI were related to the findings of the imaging studies. Five retired professional boxers (mean age, 46.8 ± 3.19 years) and four age-matched controls (mean age, 48.5 ± 3.32 years) were studied. Cognitive-motor related functional impairment was assessed, and all subjects underwent neuropsychological evaluation and behavioral tasks, as well as structural brain imaging and functional-molecular imaging. In neuropsychological tests, boxers showed deficits in delayed retrieval of visuospatial memory and motor coordination, which had a meaningful relationship with biomolecular imaging results indicative of neuronal injury. Morphometric abnormalities were not found in professional boxers by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Glucose metabolism was impaired in frontal areas associated with cognitive dysfunction, similar to findings in Alzheimer's disease. Low binding potential (BP) of (18)F-flumazenil (FMZ) was found in the angular gyrus and temporal cortical regions, revealing neuronal deficits. These results suggested that cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction reflect chronic damage to neurons in professional boxers with rTBI. "
2016-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) refers to pathologic changes that have been found in some individuals with a history of repetitive traumatic impact to the head (hereinafter referred to as head trauma). These changes cannot be assessed during the clinical evaluation of a living patient. The neuropathologic features, taxonomy, history, role of biomarkers in diagnosis, and existing criteria of CTE are reviewed. Previous criteria have been proposed to approach the living patient; however, a unified, specific approach is needed for the practicing clinician. We propose a new diagnostic construct for the clinical syndrome associated with repetitive exposure to head trauma: traumatic encephalopathy syndrome. This clinical paradigm will provide the framework for a diagnosis of probable, possible, and unlikely traumatic encephalopathy syndrome, with included discussion regarding the minimum exposure, nature of the clinical course, and additional clinical features needed for diagnosis. While prospective longitudinal studies are ongoing to further elucidate the association of exposure to head trauma, clinical features, and the development of pathologic changes, a corresponding clinical construct for diagnosis is necessary. "
2016-05-01,"Almost a century ago, the first clinical account of the punch-drunk syndrome emerged, describing chronic neurological and neuropsychiatric sequelae occurring in former boxers. Thereafter, throughout the twentieth century, further reports added to our understanding of the neuropathological consequences of a career in boxing, leading to descriptions of a distinct neurodegenerative pathology, termed dementia pugilistica. During the past decade, growing recognition of this pathology in autopsy studies of nonboxers who were exposed to repetitive, mild traumatic brain injury, or to a single, moderate or severe traumatic brain injury, has led to an awareness that it is exposure to traumatic brain injury that carries with it a risk of this neurodegenerative disease, not the sport or the circumstance in which the injury is sustained. Furthermore, the neuropathology of the neurodegeneration that occurs after traumatic brain injury, now termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is acknowledged as being a complex, mixed, but distinctive pathology, the detail of which is reviewed in this article.

2016-05-01,"Amidst a growing concern regarding concussion in sports, there is an emerging link between sport concussion and mental health outcomes. This review summarizes the current literature addressing long-term psychiatric sequelae associated with sport concussion in adults. Several databases were searched using a broad list of keywords for each of concussion, sports, and mental health, with a resultant 311 studies for initial review. After limiting studies based on duplication, appropriateness of data, and relevance, 21 studies remained pertaining to depression, anxiety, substance use, and behavioural changes, including those highlighting chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Most studies identified suggested an increased prevalence of depressive symptoms related to concussion history. A conference abstract and qualitative study suggested increasing anxiety related to concussion history; however, a PhD dissertation found no relationship. In reviewing substance use, several studies mentioned use in athletes suspected of having concussion histories, although no link was established, while another noted undiagnosed concussion as leading to current substance misuse. Regarding behavioural changes, all studies identified occurrences of behaviour and/or cognitive changes in participants, with 2 studies suggesting a link with concussion history. With respect to CTE, concerns with mood, behaviour, cognition, and substance use were consistently highlighted, suggesting relations to previous sport concussion; however, the notion of different CTE subtypes and clear aetiology behind concussion severity or frequency was not consistently elucidated. There appears to be a growing body of evidence supporting the presence of long-term psychiatric and psychological sequelae following sport concussion in adults. "

2016-05-01,"Association of repetitive brain trauma with progressive neurological deterioration has been described since the 1920s. Punch drunk syndrome and dementia pugilistica (DP) were introduced first to explain symptoms in boxers, and more recently, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been used to describe a neurodegenerative disease in athletes and military personal with a history of multiple concussions. Although there are many similarities between DP and CTE, a number of key differences are apparent especially when comparing movement impairments. The aim of this review is to compare clinical and pathological aspects of DP and CTE with a focus on disorders of movement.  "
2018-12-01,"Given questions about ""lower thresholds"" for concussion, as well as possible effects of repetitive concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and associated controversy, there is increasing interest in ""subconcussive"" blows and their potential significance. A formative review with critical examination of the developing literature on subconcussive blows in athletes with an emphasis on clinical outcomes. Studies of biomechanical, performance and/or symptom-based, and neuroimaging data were identified via PubMed search and critically reviewed. Five studies of symptom reporting/performance and 4 studies of neuroimaging were included. The relation between biomechanical parameters and diagnosed concussion is not straightforward (ie, it is not the case that greater and more force leads to more severe injury or cognitive/behavioral sequelae). Neuropsychological studies of subconcussive blows within a single athletic season have failed to demonstrate any strong and consistent relations between number and severity of subconcussive events and cognitive change. Recent studies using neuroimaging have demonstrated a potential cumulative effect of subconcussive blows, at least in a subset of individuals. Human studies of the neurological/neuropsychological impact of subconcussive blows are currently quite limited. Subconcussive blows, in the short-term, have not been shown to cause significant clinical effects. To date, findings suggest that any effect of subconcussive blows is likely to be small or nonexistent, perhaps evident in a subset of individuals on select measures, and maybe even beneficial in some cases. Longer-term prospective studies are needed to determine if there is a cumulative dose effect. "
2016-05-01,"Repeated concussive and subconcussive trauma is associated with the later development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease associated with clinical symptoms in multiple domains and a unique pattern of pathologic changes. CTE has been linked to boxing and American football; CTE has also been identified in soccer, ice hockey, baseball, rugby, and military service. To date, most large studies of CTE have come from enriched cohorts associated with brain bank donations for traumatic brain injury, although several recent studies re-examining neurodegenerative disease brain banks suggest that CTE is more common than is currently appreciated.

Football has many supporters who cite important redeeming characteristics of the activity. Public attention to the hazards of children and adults playing football has heightend recently due to many new scientific discoveries, not least of which is the frequency with which players are seriously harmed and do not recover. It is now incumbent on all interested parties to invent and implement far better safety practices, equipment, rules, and processes or the sport must cease to exist in its current form. This paper presents several safety proposals for consideration and study.  "
2016-04-01,"Tauopathies are a subclass of neurodegenerative diseases typified by the deposition of abnormal microtubule-associated tau protein within the cerebral tissue. Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and some fronto-temporal dementias are examples of the extended family of tauopathies. In the last decades, intermittent reports of cerebral tau pathology in individuals afflicted with Huntington's disease-an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder that manifests by severe motor, cognitive and psychiatric problems in adulthood-have also begun to surface. These observations remained anecdotal until recently when a series of publications brought forward compelling evidence that this monogenic disorder may, too, be a tauopathy. Collectively, these studies reported that: (i) patients with Huntington's disease present aggregated tau inclusions within various structures of the brain; (ii) tau haplotype influences the cognitive function of Huntington's disease patients; and (iii) that the genetic product of the disease, the mutant huntingtin protein, could alter tau splicing, phosphorylation, oligomerization and subcellular localization. Here, we review the past and current evidence in favour of the postulate that Huntington's disease is a new member of the family of tauopathies.  "
2016-04-01,"We used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to evaluate the effects of boxing on brain structure and cognition in 10 boxers (8 retired, 2 active; mean age = 45.7 years; standard deviation [SD] = 9.71) and 9 participants (mean age = 43.44; SD = 9.11) in noncombative sports. Evans Index (maximum width of the anterior horns of the lateral ventricles/maximal width of the internal diameter of the skull) was significantly larger in the boxers (F = 4.52; p = 0.050; Cohen's f = 0.531). Word list recall was impaired in the boxers (F(1,14) = 10.70; p = 0.006; f = 0.84), whereas implicit memory measured by faster reaction time (RT) to a repeating sequence of numbers than to a random sequence was preserved (t = 2.52; p < 0.04). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured by tractography did not significantly differ between groups. However, DTI metrics were significantly correlated with declarative memory (e.g., left ventral striatum ADC with delayed recall, r = -0.74; p = 0.02) and with RT to the repeating number sequence (r = 0.70; p = 0.04) in the boxers. Years of boxing had the most consistent, negative correlations with FA, ranging from -0.65 for the right ventral striatum to -0.92 for the right cerebral peduncle. Years of boxing was negatively related to the number of words consistently recalled over trials (r = -0.74; p = 0.02), delayed recall (r = -0.83; p = 0.003), and serial RT (r = 0.66; p = 0.05). We conclude that microstructural integrity of white matter tracts is related to declarative memory and response speed in boxers and to the extent of boxing exposure. Implications for chronic traumatic encephalopathy are discussed. "
2016-04-01,"We review current topics in sport-related head injuries including acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), traumatic cerebrovascular disease, cerebral concussion, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Sports-related ASDH is a leading cause of death and severe morbidity in popular contact sports like American football and Japanese judo. Rotational acceleration can cause either cerebral concussion or ASDH due to rupture of a parasagittal bridging vein. Although rare, approximately 80% of patients with cerebral infarction due to sport participation are diagnosed with ischemia or infarction due to arterial dissection. Computed tomography angiography, magnetic resonance angiography, and ultrasound are useful for diagnosing arterial dissection; ultrasound is particularly useful for detecting dissection of the common and internal carotid arteries. Repeated sports head injuries increase the risks of future concussion, cerebral swelling, ASDH, and CTE. To avoid fatal consequences of CTE, it is essential to understand the criteria for safe post-concussion sports participation. Once diagnosed with a concussion, an athlete should not be allowed to return to play on the same day and should not resume sports before the concussion symptoms have completely resolved. Information about the risks and management of head injuries in different sports should be widely disseminated in educational institutions and by sport organization public relations campaigns.  "
2016-04-01,"The decision to advise an athlete to retire from sports following sports-related concussion (SRC) remains a persistent challenge for physicians. In the absence of strong empirical evidence to support recommendations, clinical decision making must be individualized and should involve a multidisciplinary team of experts in concussion and traumatic brain injury. Although previous authors have advocated for a more conservative approach to these issues in child and adolescent athletes, there are few reports outlining considerations for this process among this unique population. Here, the authors use multiple case illustrations to discuss 3 subgroups of clinical considerations for sports retirement among pediatric SRC patients including the following: those with structural brain abnormalities identified on neuroimaging, those presenting with focal neurological deficits and abnormalities on physical examination, and those in whom the cumulative or prolonged effects of concussion are suspected or demonstrated. The authors' evolving multidisciplinary institutional approach to return-to-play and retirement decision making in pediatric SRC is also presented.  "
2016-04-01,"Sports-related concussions (SRCs) are traumatic events that affect up to 3.8 million athletes per year. The initial diagnosis and management is often instituted on the field of play by coaches, athletic trainers, and team physicians. SRCs are usually transient episodes of neurological dysfunction following a traumatic impact, with most symptoms resolving in 7-10 days; however, a small percentage of patients will suffer protracted symptoms for years after the event and may develop chronic neurodegenerative disease. Rarely, SRCs are associated with complications, such as skull fractures, epidural or subdural hematomas, and edema requiring neurosurgical evaluation. Current standards of care are based on a paradigm of rest and gradual return to play, with decisions driven by subjective and objective information gleaned from a detailed history and physical examination. Advanced imaging techniques such as functional MRI, and detailed understanding of the complex pathophysiological process underlying SRCs and how they affect the athletes acutely and long-term, may change the way physicians treat athletes who suffer a concussion. It is hoped that these advances will allow a more accurate assessment of when an athlete is truly safe to return to play, decreasing the risk of secondary impact injuries, and provide avenues for therapeutic strategies targeting the complex biochemical cascade that results from a traumatic injury to the brain.

2016-04-01,"Recently, the pathobiology, causes, associated factors, incidence and prevalence, and natural history of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been debated. Data from retrospective case series and high-profile media reports have fueled public fear and affected the medical community's understanding of the role of sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the development of CTE. There are a number of limitations posed by the current evidence that can lead to confusion within the public and scientific community. In this paper, the authors address common questions surrounding the science of CTE and propose future research directions.  "
2016-04-01,"Brain injuries are becoming increasingly common in athletes and represent an important diagnostic challenge. Early detection and management of brain injuries in sports are of utmost importance in preventing chronic neurological and psychiatric decline. These types of injuries incurred during sports are referred to as mild traumatic brain injuries, which represent a heterogeneous spectrum of disease. The most dramatic manifestation of chronic mild traumatic brain injuries is termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is associated with profound neuropsychiatric deficits. Because chronic traumatic encephalopathy can only be diagnosed by postmortem examination, new diagnostic methodologies are needed for early detection and amelioration of disease burden. This review examines the pathology driving changes in athletes participating in high-impact sports and how this understanding can lead to innovations in neuroimaging and biomarker discovery.  "

The onset of symptoms lags years behind the inciting events. Repetitive minor head injuries are felt to be the main etiology behind CTE. Routine radiographic imaging generally is unremarkable in cases of CTE. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) are advanced MRI-based sequences that have shown promise in detecting early radiographic findings that may be reflective of CTE. Progressive neuronal loss is the histopathological hallmark of this neurodegenerative disease.

2016-03-01,"Significant attention has been directed toward the immediate and long-term effects of sport-related concussions on athletes participating in contact sports, particularly football. The highest level of football, the National Football League (NFL), has received significant attention and criticism regarding player management and safety after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Several review articles have reported data related to concussion in the NFL, but a succinct review and synthesis of data regarding NFL concussions is currently lacking. To (1) review systematically the published data regarding concussion in the NFL and assess limitations of the studies, (2) elucidate areas where further research is needed, and (3) identify methods to improve future investigations of concussion in the NFL. Systematic review of literature. English-language titles and abstracts published between 1900 and September 2014 were searched systematically across electronic databases, and a review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Peer-reviewed journal articles were included if they contained NFL concussion data with or without additional associated long-term effects. Reviews, editorials, letters to the editor, and comments were not included. Of the 344 records screened for review, 88 articles were assessed for eligibility. There were 31 studies that met the inclusion criteria and formed the basis of the evidence synthesis. Included in the current review were 8 case-control studies (Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine evidence level 3b), 6 descriptive epidemiological studies (level 4), 6 cross-sectional studies (level 4), 6 cohort studies (level 2b), and 5 case series (level 4). The study of concussions in the NFL has been limited by lack of recent empirical data, reliance on self-reported concussion history, and ascertainment bias of brains donated for autopsy studies. The scientific community as well as the public should be cautious in interpreting the current literature surrounding concussion. "
2016-03-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by neurofibrillary tau tangles following repetitive neurotrauma. The underlying mechanism linking traumatic brain injury to chronic traumatic encephalopathy has not been elucidated. The authors investigate the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress as a link between acute neurotrauma and chronic neurodegeneration. The authors used pharmacological, biochemical, and behavioral tools to assess the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in linking acute repetitive traumatic brain injury to the development of chronic neurodegeneration. Data from the authors' clinically relevant and validated rodent blast model were compared with those obtained from postmortem human chronic traumatic encephalopathy specimens from a National Football League player and World Wrestling Entertainment wrestler. The results demonstrated strong correlation of endoplasmic reticulum stress activation with subsequent tau hyperphosphorylation. Various endoplasmic reticulum stress markers were increased in human chronic traumatic encephalopathy specimens, and the endoplasmic reticulum stress response was associated with an increase in the tau kinase, glycogen synthase kinase-3β. Docosahexaenoic acid, an endoplasmic reticulum stress inhibitor, improved cognitive performance in the rat model 3 weeks after repetitive blast exposure. The data showed that docosahexaenoic acid administration substantially reduced tau hyperphosphorylation (t = 4.111, p < 0.05), improved cognition (t = 6.532, p < 0.001), and inhibited C/EBP homology protein activation (t = 5.631, p < 0.01). Additionally the data showed, for the first time, that endoplasmic reticulum stress is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Docosahexaenoic acid therefore warrants further investigation as a potential therapeutic agent for the prevention of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. "

2016-02-01,"This study set out to investigate the behavioral correlates of changes in resting-state functional connectivity before and after performing a 20 minute continuous psychomotor vigilance task (PVT) for patients with chronic post-concussion syndrome. Ten patients in chronic phase after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) with persisting symptoms of fatigue and ten matched healthy controls participated in the study. We assessed the participants' fatigue levels and conducted resting-state fMRI before and after a sustained PVT. We evaluated the changes in brain functional connectivity indices in relation to the subject's fatigue behavior using a quantitative data-driven analysis approach. We found that the PVT invoked significant mental fatigue and specific functional connectivity changes in mTBI patients. Furthermore, we found a significant linear correlation between self-reported fatigue and functional connectivity in the thalamus and middle frontal cortex. Our findings indicate that resting-state fMRI measurements may be a useful indicator of performance potential and a marker of fatigue level in the neural attentional system.  "
2016-02-01,"Post-mortem studies reveal a high rate of cavum septi pellucidi (CSP) in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). It remains, however, to be determined whether or not the presence of CSP may be a potential in vivo imaging marker in populations at high risk to develop CTE. The aim of this study was to evaluate CSP in former professional American football players presenting with cognitive and behavioral symptoms compared with noncontact sports athletes. Seventy-two symptomatic former professional football players (mean age 54.53 years, standard deviation [SD] 7.97) as well as 14 former professional noncontact sports athletes (mean age 57.14 years, SD 7.35) underwent high-resolution structural 3T magnetic resonance imaging. Two raters independently evaluated the CSP, and interrater reliability was calculated. Within National Football League players, an association of CSP measures with cognitive and behavioral functioning was evaluated using a multivariate mixed effects model. The measurements of the two raters were highly correlated (CSP length: rho = 0.98; Intraclass Correlation Coefficient [ICC] 0.99; p < 0.0001; septum length: rho = 0.93; ICC 0.96; p < 0.0001). For presence versus absence of CSP, there was high agreement (Cohen kappa = 0.83, p < 0.0001). A higher rate of CSP, a greater length of CSP, as well as a greater ratio of CSP length to septum length was found in symptomatic former professional football players compared with athlete controls. In addition, a greater length of CSP was associated with decreased performance on a list learning task (Neuropsychological Assessment Battery List A Immediate Recall, p = 0.04) and decreased test scores on a measure of estimate verbal intelligence (Wide Range Achievement Test Fourth Edition Reading Test, p = 0.02). Given the high prevalence of CSP in neuropathologically confirmed CTE in addition to the results of this study, CSP may serve as a potential early in vivo imaging marker to identify those at high risk for CTE. Future research is needed to investigate the pathomechanism underlying the development of CSP after repetitive head impacts, and its potential association with neuropathologically confirmed CTE. "
2016-02-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been linked to dementia and chronic neurodegeneration. Described initially in boxers and currently recognized across high contact sports, the association between repeated concussion (mild TBI) and progressive neuropsychiatric abnormalities has recently received widespread attention, and has been termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Less well appreciated are cognitive changes associated with neurodegeneration in the brain after isolated spinal cord injury. Also under-recognized is the role of sustained neuroinflammation after brain or spinal cord trauma, even though this relationship has been known since the 1950s and is supported by more recent preclinical and clinical studies. These pathological mechanisms, manifested by extensive microglial and astroglial activation and appropriately termed chronic traumatic brain inflammation or chronic traumatic inflammatory encephalopathy, may be among the most important causes of post-traumatic neurodegeneration in terms of prevalence. Importantly, emerging experimental work demonstrates that persistent neuroinflammation can cause progressive neurodegeneration that may be treatable even weeks after traumatic injury. "

The cross-sectional and longitudinal assessment of the temporal and spatial patterns of tau deposition in the brain will allow a better understanding of the role tau plays in ageing as well as its relationship with cognition, genotype, and neurodegeneration. It is likely that selective tau imaging could be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of disease progression, as well as a surrogate marker for monitoring of efficacy and patient recruitment for disease-specific therapeutic trials.

2016-02-01,"Concussion has become a more recent ""medical fad"" with a lot of media coverage and hence an increasing incidence. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention there are estimates of as many as 3.8 million sport-related traumatic brain injuries occurring annually (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2007). Given these numbers, concussion care will require that both primary and specialist physicians feel comfortable in its management. This article will discuss the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical evaluation, therapies and prognosis in patients with concussion. The complex and chronic symptoms after a concussion and their management will be highlighted. Appropriate concussion care is essential for improving both the long and short term outcomes in adolescent athletes.

2016-02-01,"Mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been proposed as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, depression, and other illnesses. This study's objective was to determine the association of prior mild TBI with the subsequent diagnosis (that is, at least 1 year postinjury) of neurological or psychiatric disease. All studies from January 1995 to February 2012 reporting TBI as a risk factor for diagnoses of interest were identified by searching PubMed, study references, and review articles. Reviewers abstracted the data and assessed study designs and characteristics. Fifty-seven studies met the inclusion criteria. A random effects meta-analysis revealed a significant association of prior TBI with subsequent neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for the development of any illness subsequent to prior TBI was 1.67 (95% CI 1.44-1.93, p < 0.0001). Prior TBI was independently associated with both neurological (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.83, p < 0.0001) and psychiatric (OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.50-2.66, p < 0.0001) outcomes. Analyses of individual diagnoses revealed higher odds of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, mild cognitive impairment, depression, mixed affective disorders, and bipolar disorder in individuals with previous TBI as compared to those without TBI. This association was present when examining only studies of mild TBI and when considering the influence of study design and characteristics. Analysis of a subset of studies demonstrated no evidence that multiple TBIs were associated with higher odds of disease than a single TBI. History of TBI, including mild TBI, is associated with the development of neurological and psychiatric illness. This finding indicates that either TBI is a risk factor for heterogeneous pathological processes or that TBI may contribute to a common pathological mechanism. "
2016-02-01,"OBJECT IVE: This study directly compares the number and severity of subconcussive head impacts sustained during helmet-only practices, shell practices, full-pad practices, and competitive games in a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-A football team. The goal of the study was to determine whether subconcussive head impact in collegiate athletes varies with practice type, which is currently unregulated by the NCAA. Over an entire season, a cohort of 20 collegiate football players wore impact-sensing mastoid patches that measured the linear and rotational acceleration of all head impacts during a total of 890 athletic exposures. Data were analyzed to compare the number of head impacts, head impact burden, and average impact severity during helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices, and games. Helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices and games all significantly differed from each other (p ≤ 0.05) in the mean number of impacts for each event, with the number of impacts being greatest for games, then full-pad practices, then shell practices, and then helmet-only practices. The cumulative distributions for both linear and rotational acceleration differed between all event types (p < 0.01), with the acceleration distribution being similarly greatest for games, then full-pad practices, then shell practices, and then helmet-only practices. For both linear and rotational acceleration, helmet-only practices had a lower average impact severity when compared with other event types (p < 0.001). However, the average impact severity did not differ between any comparisons of shell and full-pad practices, and games. Helmet-only, shell, and full-pad practices, and games result in distinct head impact profiles per event, with each succeeding event type receiving more impacts than the one before. Both the number of head impacts and cumulative impact burden during practice are categorically less than in games. In practice events, the number and cumulative burden of head impacts per event increases with the amount of equipment worn. The average severity of individual impacts is relatively consistent across event types, with the exception of helmet-only practices. The number of hits experienced during each event type is the main driver of event type differences in impact burden per athletic exposure, rather than the average severity of impacts that occur during the event. These findings suggest that regulation of practice equipment could be a fair and effective way to substantially reduce subconcussive head impact in thousands of collegiate football players. "
2016-02-01,"Few neurologic diseases have captured the nation's attention more completely than chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which has been discovered in the autopsies of professional athletes, most notably professional football players. The tragic case of Junior Seau, a Hall of Fame, National Football League linebacker, has been the most high-profile confirmed case of CTE. Here we describe Seau's case, which concludes an autopsy conducted at the National Institutes of Health that confirmed the diagnosis. Since 1990, Junior Seau had a highly distinguished 20-year career playing for the National Football League as a linebacker, from which he sustained multiple concussions. He committed suicide on May 2, 2012, at age 43, after which an autopsy confirmed a diagnosis of CTE. His clinical history was significant for a series of behavioral disturbances. Seau's history and neuropathologic findings were used to better understand the pathophysiology, diagnosis, and possible risk factors for CTE. This high-profile case reflects an increasing awareness of CTE as a long-term consequence of multiple traumatic brain injuries. The previously unforeseen neurologic risks of American football have begun to cast doubt on the safety of the sport. "
2016-01-01,"Concussion is a serious health concern. Concussion in athletes is of particular interest with respect to the relationship of concussion exposure to risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative condition associated with altered cognitive and psychiatric functions and profound tauopathy. However, much remains to be learned about factors other than cumulative exposure that could influence concussion pathogenesis. Approximately 20% of CTE cases report a history of substance use including androgenic-anabolic steroids (AAS). How acute, chronic, or historical AAS use may affect the vulnerability of the brain to concussion is unknown. We therefore tested whether antecedent AAS exposure in young, male C57Bl/6 mice affects acute behavioral and neuropathological responses to mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) induced with the CHIMERA (Closed Head Impact Model of Engineered Rotational Acceleration) platform. Male C57Bl/6 mice received either vehicle or a cocktail of three AAS (testosterone, nandrolone and 17α-methyltestosterone) from 8-16 weeks of age. At the end of the 7th week of treatment, mice underwent two closed-head TBI or sham procedures spaced 24 h apart using CHIMERA. Post-repetitive TBI (rTBI) behavior was assessed for 7 d followed by tissue collection. AAS treatment induced the expected physiological changes including increased body weight, testicular atrophy, aggression and downregulation of brain 5-HT1B receptor expression. rTBI induced behavioral deficits, widespread axonal injury and white matter microgliosis. While AAS treatment did not worsen post-rTBI behavioral changes, AAS-treated mice exhibited significantly exacerbated axonal injury and microgliosis, indicating that AAS exposure can alter neuronal and innate immune responses to concussive TBI.

2016-01-01,"We sought to determine whether the exposure to the sub-concussive blows that occur during division III collegiate collision sports affect later life neurobehavioral quality-of-life measures. We conducted a cross-sectional study of alumni from four division III colleges, targeting those between the ages of 40-70 years, using several well-validated quality-of-life measures for executive function, general concerns, anxiety, depression, emotional and behavior dyscontrol, fatigue, positive affect, sleep disturbance, and negative consequences of alcohol use. We used multivariable linear regression to assess for associations between collision sport participation and quality-of-life measures while adjusting for covariates including age, gender, race, annual income, highest educational degree, college grades, exercise frequency, and common medical conditions. We obtained data from 3702 alumni, more than half of whom (2132) had participated in collegiate sports, 23% in collision sports, 23% in non-contact sports. Respondents with a history of concussion had worse self-reported health on several measures. When subjects with a history of concussion were removed from the analyses in order to assess for any potential effect of sub-concussive blows alone, negative consequences of alcohol use remained higher among collision sport athletes (β-coefficient 1.957, 95% CI 0.827-3.086). There were, however, no other significant associations between exposure to collision sports during college and any other quality-of-life measures. Our results suggest that, in the absence of a history of concussions, participation in collision sports at the Division III collegiate level is not a risk factor for worse long-term neurobehavioral outcomes, despite exposure to repeated sub-concussive blows.

2016-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegeneration characterized by the abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein within the brain. Like many other neurodegenerative conditions, at present, CTE can only be definitively diagnosed by post-mortem examination of brain tissue. As the first part of a series of consensus panels funded by the NINDS/NIBIB to define the neuropathological criteria for CTE, preliminary neuropathological criteria were used by 7 neuropathologists to blindly evaluate 25 cases of various tauopathies, including CTE, Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, argyrophilic grain disease, corticobasal degeneration, primary age-related tauopathy, and parkinsonism dementia complex of Guam. The results demonstrated that there was good agreement among the neuropathologists who reviewed the cases (Cohen's kappa, 0.67) and even better agreement between reviewers and the diagnosis of CTE (Cohen's kappa, 0.78). Based on these results, the panel defined the pathognomonic lesion of CTE as an accumulation of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) in neurons and astroglia distributed around small blood vessels at the depths of cortical sulci and in an irregular pattern. The group also defined supportive but non-specific p-tau-immunoreactive features of CTE as: pretangles and NFTs affecting superficial layers (layers II-III) of cerebral cortex; pretangles, NFTs or extracellular tangles in CA2 and pretangles and proximal dendritic swellings in CA4 of the hippocampus; neuronal and astrocytic aggregates in subcortical nuclei; thorn-shaped astrocytes at the glial limitans of the subpial and periventricular regions; and large grain-like and dot-like structures. Supportive non-p-tau pathologies include TDP-43 immunoreactive neuronal cytoplasmic inclusions and dot-like structures in the hippocampus, anteromedial temporal cortex and amygdala. The panel also recommended a minimum blocking and staining scheme for pathological evaluation and made recommendations for future study. This study provides the first step towards the development of validated neuropathological criteria for CTE and will pave the way towards future clinical and mechanistic studies.  "
2016-10-01,"To examine publicly-available information on all identified cases of suicide in active or former American professional football players between 1920 and the spring of 2015. Retrospective cohort study. Professional American Football in the US. A cohort of 26 702 athletes who had died, retired or were currently playing in the NFL from nfl.com since 1920 was identified. Internet queries identifying 26 professional football players who completed suicide. Obituaries and news reports were reviewed. The primary outcome measures included mortality, demographic characteristics and life circumstances in professional American football players completing suicide. From 1920-2015, the median age of the 26 men who completed suicide was 39.5 years (range = 23-85). The median number of years after retirement was 6.5 (range = 0-63). Most of the deaths since 1920 have occurred in the past 15 years (58.7%) and a large percentage have occurred since 2009 (42.3%). Most of the men suffered from multiple life stressors prior to their deaths, such as retirement from sport, loss of steady income, divorce, failed business ventures, estrangement from family members and medical, psychiatric and/or substance abuse problems. A disproportionate number of completed suicides in current and former professional football players have occurred since 2009 (42.3%). It is well established in the literature that the causes of depression and suicidality are diverse, often multifactorial and treatable. Providing at-risk retired athletes with mental health treatment will likely reduce their suffering and improve their quality-of-life. "
2018-11-01,"To test the hypothesis that the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM), a cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) cortical projection system, develops neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) during the progressive pathological stages of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in the brain of athletes. To characterize NFT pathology, tau-antibodies marking early, intermediate and late stages of NFT development in CBF tissue obtained at autopsy from eighteen former athletes and veterans with a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) were used. Analysis revealed that cholinergic nbM neurons develop intracellular tau-immunoreactive changes progressively across the pathological stages of CTE. In particular, there was an increase in pre-tangle (phosphorylated pS422) and oligomeric (TOC1 and TNT1) forms of tau in stage IV compared to stage II CTE cases. The nbM neurons also displayed pathologic TDP-43 inclusions and diffuse extracellular and vascular amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in CTE. A higher percentage of pS422/p75 The development of NFTs within the cholinergic nbM neurons could contribute to an axonal disconnection in CTE. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanism driving NFT formation in the nbM neurons and its relation to chronic cognitive dysfunction in CTE. "
2016-08-01,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have long been recognized as sharing some similar neuropathological features, mainly the presence of neurofibrilary tangles and hyperphosphorylated tau, but have generally been described as distinct entities. Evidence indicates that neurotrauma increases the risk of developing dementia and accelerates the progression of disease. Findings are emerging that CTE and AD may be present in the same patients. This study presents a series of previously unpublished cases, with one case demonstrating possible neurotrauma-related AD, one pure CTE, and an example of a case exhibiting features of both AD and CTE. The future significance of this work lies not only in the confirmation of AD-CTE co-existence, but, more importantly, ways of generating a hypothesis about the possibility that CTE may accelerate AD development. Understanding the relationship between neurotrauma and neurodegenerative disease will help elucidate how distinct disease entities can co-exist in the same patient. It will ultimately require the use of pre-clinical animal models and repeat injury paradigms to investigate clinically relevant injury mechanisms. These models should produce a CTE-like phenotype that must be both neuropathologically and behaviourally similar to human disease. This case series and review of the literature presents a discussion of AD and CTE in the context of neurotrauma. It highlights recent work from repetitive neurotrauma models with an emphasis on those exhibiting a CTE-like phenotype. Potential mechanisms of interest shared amongst AD and CTE are briefly addressed and future experiments are advocated for to enhance understanding of CTE pathophysiology and the relationship between CTE and AD. "
2016-01-01,"Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) is one of the major risk factors for the abnormal deposition of phosphorylated tau (PT) in the brain and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE and temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) affect the limbic system, but no comparative studies on PT distribution in TLE and CTE are available. It is also unclear whether PT pathology results from repeated head hits (rTBI). These gaps prevent a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis and clinical significance of PT, limiting our ability to develop preventative and therapeutic interventions. We quantified PT in TLE and CTE to unveil whether a history of rTBI is a prerequisite for PT accumulation in the brain. Six postmortem CTE (mean 73.3 years) and age matched control samples were compared to 19 surgically resected TLE brain specimens (4 months-58 years; mean 27.6 years). No history of TBI was present in TLE or control; all CTE patients had a history of rTBI. TLE and CTE brain displayed increased levels of PT as revealed by immunohistochemistry. No age-dependent changes were noted, as PT was present as early as 4 months after birth. In TLE and CTE, cortical neurons, perivascular regions around penetrating pial vessels and meninges were immunopositive for PT; white matter tracts also displayed robust expression of extracellular PT organized in bundles parallel to venules. Microscopically, there were extensive tau-immunoreactive neuronal, astrocytic and degenerating neurites throughout the brain. In CTE perivascular tangles were most prominent. Overall, significant differences in staining intensities were found between CTE and control (P<0.01) but not between CTE and TLE (P=0.08). pS199 tau analysis showed that CTE had the most high molecular weight tangle-associated tau, whereas epileptic brain contained low molecular weight tau. Tau deposition may not be specific to rTBI since TLE recapitulated most of the pathological features of CTE.  "
2019-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major public health and socio-economic problem, and 70-90% of all TBIs are classified as mild. Mild TBIs and concussions are mostly considered to be non-serious conditions with symptoms subsiding within a few days or weeks. However in 10-15% of patients, the symptoms persist one year after concussion and mostly include headache, fatigue, irritability, and cognitive problems (e.g. memory, concentration). These persisting symptoms negatively influence patient daily activities as postconcussion syndrome (PCS). Second-impact syndrome (SIS) is a very rare but usually fatal condition and occurs when repeated brain injuries lead to a catastrophic diffuse brain swelling. There is no scientific evidence on the incidence and risk of SIS. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive degenerative disease of the brain found in patients with a history of repetitive brain trauma. CTE presents with behavioural, cognitive, and motor symptoms. The literature to date lacks prospective epidemiological studies of the incidence of CTE. In recent medical literature, there is a description of 110 athletes with postmortem diagnosis of CTE (Tab. 1, Ref. 37). "
2019-11-01,"A disease initially associated with boxers ninety years ago, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is now recognized as a significant risk to boxers, American football players, ice hockey players, military personnel or anyone to whom recurrent head injuries are a distinct possibility. Diagnosis is currently confirmed at autopsy, although CTE's presumed sufferers have symptoms of depression, suicidal thoughts, mood and personality changes, and loss of memory. CTE sufferers also complain of losing cognitive ability, dysfunction in everyday activities, inability to keep regular employment, violent tendencies and marital strife. Dementia may develop over the long term. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus in regards to pathology, with both number and severity of head injuries being linked to disease progression. Despite the slow advancement of this disease, there are no clinical methods to diagnose or monitor prognosis in presumed patients, limiting clinicians' efforts to symptom management. The lack of diagnostic tools fuels the need for biomedical engineers to develop techniques for in vivo detection of CTE. This review examines efforts made with various magnetic resonance and nuclear imaging techniques, with a view towards improving the sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging for CTE. "
2016-01-01,"Neuropathological studies of human traumatic brain injury (TBI) cases have described amyloid plaques acutely after a single severe TBI, and tau pathology after repeat mild TBI (mTBI). This has helped drive the hypothesis that a single moderate to severe TBI increases the risk of developing late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), while repeat mTBI increases the risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In this review we critically assess this position-examining epidemiological and case control human studies, neuropathological evidence, and preclinical data. Epidemiological studies emphasize that TBI is associated with the increased risk of developing multiple types of dementia, not just AD-type dementia, and that TBI can also trigger other neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson's disease. Further, human post-mortem studies on both single TBI and repeat mTBI can show combinations of amyloid, tau, TDP-43, and Lewy body pathology indicating that the neuropathology of TBI is best described as a 'polypathology'. Preclinical studies confirm that multiple proteins associated with the development of neurodegenerative disease accumulate in the brain after TBI. The chronic sequelae of both single TBI and repeat mTBI share common neuropathological features and clinical symptoms of classically defined neurodegenerative disorders. However, while the spectrum of chronic cognitive and neurobehavioral disorders that occur following repeat mTBI is viewed as the symptoms of CTE, the spectrum of chronic cognitive and neurobehavioral symptoms that occur after a single TBI is considered to represent distinct neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. These data support the suggestion that the multiple manifestations of TBI-induced neurodegenerative disorders be classified together as traumatic encephalopathy or trauma-induced neurodegeneration, regardless of the nature or frequency of the precipitating TBI.  "
2016-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurological and psychiatric condition marked by preferential perivascular foci of neurofibrillary and glial tangles (composed of hyperphosphorylated-tau proteins) in the depths of the sulci. Recent retrospective case series published over the last decade on athletes and military personnel have added considerably to our clinical and histopathological knowledge of CTE. This has marked a vital turning point in the traumatic brain injury (TBI) field, raising public awareness of the potential long-term effects of mild and moderate repetitive TBI, which has been recognized as one of the major risk factors associated with CTE. Although these human studies have been informative, their retrospective design carries certain inherent limitations that should be cautiously interpreted. In particular, the current overriding issue in the CTE literature remains confusing in regard to appropriate definitions of terminology, variability in individual pathologies and the potential case selection bias in autopsy based studies. There are currently no epidemiological or prospective studies on CTE. Controlled preclinical studies in animals therefore provide an alternative means for specifically interrogating aspects of CTE pathogenesis. In this article, we review the current literature and discuss difficulties and challenges of developing in-vivo TBI experimental paradigms to explore the link between repetitive head trauma and tau-dependent changes. We provide our current opinion list of recommended features to consider for successfully modeling CTE in animals to better understand the pathobiology and develop therapeutics and diagnostics, and critical factors, which might influence outcome. We finally discuss the possible directions of future experimental research in the repetitive TBI/CTE field.  "
2016-01-01,"Traumatic cerebral vascular injury (TCVI) is a very frequent, if not universal, feature after traumatic brain injury (TBI). It is likely responsible, at least in part, for functional deficits and TBI-related chronic disability. Because there are multiple pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic therapies that promote vascular health, TCVI is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention after TBI. The cerebral microvasculature is a component of the neurovascular unit (NVU) coupling neuronal metabolism with local cerebral blood flow. The NVU participates in the pathogenesis of TBI, either directly from physical trauma or as part of the cascade of secondary injury that occurs after TBI. Pathologically, there is extensive cerebral microvascular injury in humans and experimental animal, identified with either conventional light microscopy or ultrastructural examination. It is seen in acute and chronic TBI, and even described in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Non-invasive, physiologic measures of cerebral microvascular function show dysfunction after TBI in humans and experimental animal models of TBI. These include imaging sequences (MRI-ASL), Transcranial Doppler (TCD), and Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (NIRS). Understanding the pathophysiology of TCVI, a relatively under-studied component of TBI, has promise for the development of novel therapies for TBI.  "
2016-01-01,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) affects millions of people annually and is difficult to diagnose. Mild injury is insensitive to conventional imaging techniques and diagnoses are often made using subjective criteria such as self-reported symptoms. Many people who sustain a mTBI develop persistent post-concussive symptoms. Athletes and military personnel are at great risk for repeat injury which can result in second impact syndrome or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. An objective and quantifiable measure, such as a serum biomarker, is needed to aid in mTBI diagnosis, prognosis, return to play/duty assessments, and would further elucidate mTBI pathophysiology. The majority of TBI biomarker research focuses on severe TBI with few studies specific to mild injury. Most studies use a hypothesis-driven approach, screening biofluids for markers known to be associated with TBI pathophysiology. This approach has yielded limited success in identifying markers that can be used clinically, additional candidate biomarkers are needed. Innovative and unbiased methods such as proteomics, microRNA arrays, urinary screens, autoantibody identification and phage display would complement more traditional approaches to aid in the discovery of novel mTBI biomarkers.

2018-11-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy associated with prior exposure to repetitive head impacts, such as those incurred through American football and other collision sports. Diagnosis is made through neuropathological examination. Many of the clinical features of CTE are common in the general population, with and without a history of head impact exposure, making clinical diagnosis difficult. As is now common in the diagnosis of other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease, there is a need for methods to diagnose CTE during life through objective biomarkers. The aim of this study was to examine tau-positive exosomes in plasma as a potential CTE biomarker. Subjects were 78 former National Football League (NFL) players and 16 controls. Extracellular vesicles were isolated from plasma. Fluorescent nanoparticle tracking analysis was used to determine the number of vesicles staining positive for tau. The NFL group had higher exosomal tau than the control group (p <  0.0001). Exosomal tau discriminated between the groups, with 82% sensitivity, 100% specificity, 100% positive predictive value, and 53% negative predictive value. Within the NFL group, higher exosomal tau was associated with worse performance on tests of memory (p = 0.0126) and psychomotor speed (p = 0.0093). These preliminary findings suggest that exosomal tau in plasma may be an accurate, noninvasive CTE biomarker. "
2016-10-01,"The brain is a complex system that requires continual regulation of parenchymal pressure, osmolarity, and waste removal for optimal function; despite this, human brain lacks any obvious extension of lymphatic circulation for moderating fluid and waste regulation. We recapitulate herein a recent analysis of proteinaceous waste deposition in the human brain, its observed route of clearance, and the implications of abnormal accumulation along this clearance pathway as a potential mechanism of neurological diseases. This study uncovered an analogous staining pattern of cerebral phosphorylated tau in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Regardless of the underlying physiopathology, p-tau elimination occurred via circulation through the perivenous space, as predicted by a glymphatic route of clearance. Remarkably, we demonstrated that p-tau is associated with a neurological disease that can develop independent of head trauma, since in both CTE and TLE: 1) Extracellular p-tau followed unidirectional, fluid-driven pathways that led toward the space bordering large (>100 μm diameter) blood vessels; 2) Tau-positive staining occurred within astroglial cells adjacent to blood vessels, which signified transcellular transport of p-tau as a potential secondary efflux route; 3) P-tau frequently appeared clustered within the perivenous space. This waste aggregation bears significant implications in the disruption of interstitial fluid circulation, which may contribute to exacerbation of disease states. A better understanding of waste elimination in the human brain may prove significant as a therapeutic target to improve parenchymal fluid circulation, and consequently, mitigate the hydrostatic, osmotic and oncotic imbalances that often cause or exacerbate brain diseases. "
2016-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative tauopathy that develops after repetitive head injury. Several lines of evidence in other tauopathies suggest that tau oligomer formation induces neurotoxicity and that tau oligomer-mediated neurotoxicity involves induction of axonal dysfunction through exposure of an N-terminal motif in tau, the phosphatase-activating domain (PAD). Additionally, phosphorylation at serine 422 in tau occurs early and correlates with cognitive decline in patients with Alzheimer disease (AD). We performed immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence on fixed brain sections and biochemical analysis of fresh brain extracts to characterize the presence of PAD-exposed tau (TNT1 antibody), tau oligomers (TOC1 antibody), tau phosphorylated at S422 (pS422 antibody), and tau truncated at D421 (TauC3 antibody) in the brains of 9-11 cases with CTE and cases of nondemented aged controls and AD (Braak VI) (n = 6, each). All 3 early tau markers (ie, TNT1, TOC1, and pS422) were present in CTE and displayed extensive colocalization in perivascular tau lesions that are considered diagnostic for CTE. Notably, the TauC3 epitope, which is abundant in AD, was relatively sparse in CTE. Together, these results provide the first description of PAD exposure, TOC1 reactive oligomers, phosphorylation of S422, and TauC3 truncation in the tau pathology of CTE. "
2015-10-01,"For nearly 80 years, suicidality was not considered to be a core clinical feature of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In recent years, suicide has been widely cited as being associated with CTE, and now depression has been proposed to be one of three core diagnostic features alongside cognitive impairment and anger control problems. This evolution of the clinical features has been reinforced by thousands of media stories reporting a connection between mental health problems in former athletes and military veterans, repetitive neurotrauma, and CTE. At present, the science underlying the causal assumption between repetitive neurotrauma, depression, suicide, and the neuropathology believed to be unique to CTE is inconclusive. Epidemiological evidence indicates that former National Football League players, for example, are at lower, not greater, risk for suicide than men in the general population. This article aims to discuss the critical issues and literature relating to these possible relationships.  "
2016-01-01,"Abnormally aggregated tau protein is central to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia variants, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The post-mortem cortical density of hyperphosphorylated tau tangles correlates with pre-morbid cognitive dysfunction and neuron loss. Selective PET ligands including [18F]THK5117, [18F]THK5351, [18F]AV1451 (T807) and [11C]PBB3 now provide in vivo imaging information about the timing and distribution of tau in the early phases of neurodegenerative diseases. They are potential imaging biomarkers for both supporting diagnosis and tracking disease progression. Here, we discuss the challenges posed in developing selective tau ligands as biomarkers, their state of development and the new clinical information that has been revealed. "
2016-01-01,"The association between exposure to head injury and increased risk of neurodegenerative disease, specifically chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is widely recognized. Historically, this was largely considered a phenomenon restricted to boxers, with more recent case series identifying further 'high risk' individuals, such as former American footballers, or military personnel. However, in all cases thus far reported, it is clear that it is the exposure to head injury which is associated with increased dementia risk, and not the circumstances or environment of exposure. As such, there is considerable potential for under-recognition of CTE in patients presenting with neurodegenerative disease, particularly where head injury exposure might have been historical and through sport. This article reviews current understanding of CTE and, via an illustrative case in rugby union, highlights the value of a detailed history on head injury and also draws attention to imaging studies in assessing patients with neurodegenerative disease.  "
2016-01-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), a major global health and socioeconomic problem, is now established as a chronic disease process with a broad spectrum of pathophysiological symptoms followed by long-term disabilities. It triggers multiple and multidirectional biochemical events that lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment. Recent studies have presented strong evidence that patients with TBI history have a tendency to develop proteinopathy, which is the pathophysiological feature of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This review mainly focuses on mechanisms related to AD, CTE, and ALS that are induced after TBI and their relevance to the advancement of these neurodegenerative diseases. This review encompasses acute effects and chronic neurodegenerative consequences after TBI for a better understanding of TBI-induced neuronal death and to design therapies that will effectively treat patients in the primary or secondary progressive stages.

2016-01-01,"In this review we present the most recent advances in nuclear medicine imaging as a diagnostic and management tool for dementia. The clinical diagnosis of dementia syndromes can be challenging for physicians, particularly in the early stages of disease. Given the growing number of individuals affected by dementia, early and accurate diagnosis can lead to improved clinical management of patients. Although tests are available for exclusion of certain causes of cognitive impairment, the results rarely allow the clinician to make a definitive diagnosis. For this reason, information obtained from imaging (""imaging biomarkers"") is playing an increasingly important role in the workup of patients with suspected dementia. Imaging biomarkers also provide indispensable tools for clinical and preclinical studies of dementing illnesses to elucidate their pathophysiology and to develop better therapies. A wide range of imaging has been used to diagnose and investigate neurodegenerative disorders including structural, cerebral perfusion, glucose metabolism, neurochemical, and molecular imaging. In the first section, we discuss the imaging methods used in clinical practice to diagnose dementia as well as explore additional experimental modalities that are currently used as research tools. In the second section, a comprehensive review covering the myriad aspects of vascular disease as a cause of dementia is presented and illustrated with MRI- and PET-focused case examples. In the third section, advances in imaging Alzheimer disease pathology are emphasized by reviewing current approaches for PET imaging with β-amyloid imaging agents. We provide an outline for the appropriate use criteria for β-amyloid imaging agents in dementia. In addition, the recognition of the importance of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles as related to Alzheimer disease progression has led to the development of promising tau imaging agents such as [(18)F]T807. The last section provides a history brain trauma as a cause of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Although the recognition of cognitive deficits from brain trauma dates back to the early part of last century, recent advances in our understanding of the neurobiology has led to the hope of developing molecular imaging methods for earlier diagnoses and treatment. This has become increasingly important given the raised public and physician awareness of the high incidence of this pathology in military conflicts and sports-related injuries. Overall advancements in nuclear medicine imaging have led to an improvement in the detection and accurate identification of dementia and its underlying causes. With both primary and secondary causes of dementia demonstrating often overlapping presentations, nuclear medicine imaging can play a key role not only in the diagnosis but the understanding of dementia. With earlier diagnosis and better understanding comes the hope of improved treatments or possibly someday a cure.  "
2015-06-01,"The diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) can only be made pathologically, and there is no concordance of defined clinical criteria for premorbid diagnosis. The absence of established criteria and the insufficient imaging findings to detect this disease in a living athlete are of growing concern. The article is a review of the current literature on CTE. Databases searched include Medline, PubMed, JAMA evidence, and evidence-based medicine guidelines Cochrane Library, Hospital for Special Surgery, and Cornell Library databases. Clinical review.

2015-12-01,"Millions of people experience traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a result of falls, car accidents, sports injury, and blast. TBI has been associated with the development of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In the initial hours and days, the pathology of TBI comprises neuronal injury, breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, and inflammation. At the cellular level, the inflammatory reaction consists of responses by brain-resident microglia, astrocytes, and vascular elements as well as infiltration of peripheral cells. After TBI, signaling by chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) to the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) is a key regulator of brain infiltration by monocytes. We utilized mice with one or both copies of Ccr2 disrupted by red fluorescent protein (RFP, Ccr2 (RFP/+) and Ccr2 (RFP/RFP) ). We subjected these mice to the mild lateral fluid percussion model of TBI and examined several pathological outcomes 3 days later in order to determine the effects of altered monocyte entry into the brain. Ccr2 deletion reduced monocyte infiltration, diminished lesion cavity volume, and lessened axonal damage after mild TBI, but the microglial reaction to the lesion was not affected. We further examined phosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau, which aggregates in brains of people with TBI, AD, and CTE. Surprisingly, Ccr2 deletion was associated with increased tau mislocalization to the cell body in the cortex and hippocampus by tissue staining and increased levels of phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus by Western blot. Disruption of CCR2 enhanced tau pathology and reduced cavity volume in the context of TBI. The data reveal a complex role for CCR2(+) monocytes in TBI, as monitored by cavity volume, axonal damage, and tau phosphorylation. "
2015-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder linked to repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI) and characterized by deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau at the depths of sulci. We sought to determine the presence of CTE pathology in a brain bank for neurodegenerative disorders for individuals with and without a history of contact sports participation. Available medical records of 1721 men were reviewed for evidence of past history of injury or participation in contact sports. Subsequently, cerebral cortical samples were processed for tau immunohistochemistry in cases with a documented history of sports exposure as well as age- and disease-matched men and women without such exposure. For cases with available frozen tissue, genetic analysis was performed for variants in APOE, MAPT, and TMEM106B. Immunohistochemistry revealed 21 of 66 former athletes had cortical tau pathology consistent with CTE. CTE pathology was not detected in 198 individuals without exposure to contact sports, including 33 individuals with documented single-incident TBI sustained from falls, motor vehicle accidents, domestic violence, or assaults. Among those exposed to contact sports, those with CTE pathology did not differ from those without CTE pathology with respect to noted clinicopathologic features. There were no significant differences in genetic variants for those with CTE pathology, but we observed a slight increase in MAPT H1 haplotype, and there tended to be fewer homozygous carriers of the protective TMEM106B rs3173615 minor allele in those with sports exposure and CTE pathology compared to those without CTE pathology. In conclusion, this study has identified a small, yet significant, subset of individuals with neurodegenerative disorders and concomitant CTE pathology. CTE pathology was only detected in individuals with documented participation in contact sports. Exposure to contact sports was the greatest risk factor for CTE pathology. Future studies addressing clinical correlates of CTE pathology are needed.  "

2015-12-01,"A total of 1.7 million traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) occur each year in the United States, but available pharmacologic options for the treatment of acute neurotrauma are limited. Oxidative stress is an important secondary mechanism of injury that can lead to neuronal apoptosis and subsequent behavioral changes. Using a clinically relevant and validated rodent blast model, we investigated how nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (Nox) expression and associated oxidative stress contribute to cellular apoptosis after single and repeat blast injuries. Nox4 forms a complex with p22phox after injury, forming free radicals at neuronal membranes. Using immunohistochemical-staining methods, we found a visible increase in Nox4 after single blast injury in Sprague Dawley rats. Interestingly, Nox4 was also increased in postmortem human samples obtained from athletes diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Nox4 activity correlated with an increase in superoxide formation. Alpha-lipoic acid, an oxidative stress inhibitor, prevented the development of superoxide acutely and increased antiapoptotic markers B-cell lymphoma 2 (t = 3.079, P < 0.05) and heme oxygenase 1 (t = 8.169, P < 0.001) after single blast. Subacutely, alpha-lipoic acid treatment reduced proapoptotic markers Bax (t = 4.483, P < 0.05), caspase 12 (t = 6.157, P < 0.001), and caspase 3 (t = 4.573, P < 0.01) after repetitive blast, and reduced tau hyperphosphorylation indicated by decreased CP-13 and paired helical filament staining. Alpha-lipoic acid ameliorated impulsive-like behavior 7 days after repetitive blast injury (t = 3.573, P < 0.05) compared with blast exposed animals without treatment. TBI can cause debilitating symptoms and psychiatric disorders. Oxidative stress is an ideal target for neuropharmacologic intervention, and alpha-lipoic acid warrants further investigation as a therapeutic for prevention of chronic neurodegeneration. "
2015-11-01,"Dephosphorylation of phosphorylated Tau (pTau) protein, which is essential for the preservation of neuronal microtubule assemblies and for protection against trauma-induced tauopathy and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is primarily achieved in brain by tissue non-specific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP). Paired helical filaments (PHFs) and Tau isolated from Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brains have been shown to form microtubule assemblies with tubulin only after treatment with TNAP or protein phosphatase-2A, 2B and -1, suggesting that Tau protein in the PHFs of neurons in AD brain is hyperphosphorylated, which prevents microtubule assembly. Using blast or weight drop models of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in rats, we observed pTau accumulation in the brain as early as 6h post-injury and further accumulation which varied regionally by 24h post-injury. The pTau accumulation was accompanied by reduced TNAP expression and activity in these brain regions and a significantly decreased plasma total alkaline phosphatase activity after the weight drop. These results reveal that both blast- and impact acceleration-induced head injuries cause an acute decrease in the level/activity of TNAP in the brain, which potentially contributes to trauma-induced accumulation of pTau and the resultant tauopathy. The regional changes in the level/activity of TNAP or accumulation of pTau after these injuries did not correlate with the accumulation of amyloid precursor protein, suggesting that the basic mechanism underlying tauopathy in TBI might be distinct from that associated with AD.  "
2015-11-01,"The emergent management of a traumatic injury can be an extremely intense situation. These assessments can be even more difficult when patients have an underlying psychiatric condition. After a protocoled evaluation of the traumatic injuries, the psychological manifestation of diseases can be addressed. The appropriate use of physical or chemical restraints to facilitate the work-up is paramount in the ability of the provider to protect patients and staff from agitated and traumatized patients. The emergency medicine provider should have a low threshold for including psychiatry in the treatment plans, as the long-term sequelae of these entities require specialized treatment. "
2015-11-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is associated with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in the context of contact and collision sports, but not all exposed individuals develop this condition. In addition, experiments in animal models in several laboratories have shown that non-transgenic mice do not develop tauopathy after exposure to repetitive mTBI schedules. It is thus reasonable to assume that genetic factors may play an etiological role in the development of CTE. More than 40 mutations in the tau gene are known to confer proneness to aggregation and are thought to cause neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal degeneration (FTD). Transgenic mice harboring these mutations can be used to ask the question whether repetitive mTBI can accelerate onset and course of tauopathy or worsen the outcomes of transgenic disease. In this study, we exposed mice harboring the tau P301S transgene associated with FTD to repetitive mTBI schedules by impact acceleration (IA) that we have previously characterized. We explored the progression of tauopathy in the retina and neocortex based on density of neuronal profiles loaded with tau pS422, a marker of advanced tau hyperphosphorylation. We found that the density of tau pS422 (+) retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) increased twenty fold with one mTBI hit, a little over fifty fold with four mTBI hits and sixty fold with 12 mTBI hits. The severity of mTBI burden (number of hits) was a significant factor in tauopathy outcome. On the other hand, we found no association between repetitive mTBI and density of pS422 (+) neuronal profiles in neocortex, a region that is not featured by significant TAI in our repetitive mTBI model. We observed similar, but less prominent, trends in tauopathy-prone transgenic mice harboring all 6 isoforms of wild-type human tau without mouse tau. Our findings indicate that repetitive mTBI accelerates tauopathy under diverse genetic conditions predisposing to tau aggregation and suggest a vulnerability-stress model in understanding some cases of acquired neurodegenerative disease after repetitive mTBI.

2015-10-01,"Recent case reports have described athletes previously exposed to repetitive head trauma while participating in contact sports who later in life developed mood disorders, headaches, cognitive difficulties, suicidal ideation, difficulties with speech, and aggressive behavior. Postmortem discoveries show that some of these athletes have pathologic findings that are collectively termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Current hypotheses suggest that concussions or perhaps blows to the head that do not cause the signs and symptoms necessary for making the diagnosis of concussion, so-called subconcussive blows, cause both the clinical and pathologic findings. There are, however, some athletes who participate in contact sports who do not develop the findings ascribed to CTE. Furthermore, there are people who have headaches, mood disorders, cognitive difficulties, suicidal ideation, and other clinical problems who have neither been exposed to repeated head trauma nor possessed the pathologic postmortem findings of those currently diagnosed with CTE. The current lack of prospective data and properly designed case-control studies limits the current understanding of CTE, leading to debate about the causes of the neuropathologic findings and the clinical observations. Given the potential for referral and recall bias in available studies, it remains unclear whether or not the pathologic findings made postmortem cause the presumed neurobehavioral sequela and whether the presumed risk factors, such as sports activity, cerebral concussions, and subconcussive blows, are solely causative of the clinical signs and symptoms. This article discusses the current evidence and the associated limitations.  "
2015-10-01,"Despite the extensive media coverage associated with the diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), our fundamental understanding of the disease pathophysiology remains in its infancy. Only recently have scientific laboratories and personnel begun to explore CTE pathophysiology through the use of preclinical models of neurotrauma. Some studies have shown the ability to recapitulate some aspects of CTE in rodent models, through the use of various neuropathological, biochemical, and/or behavioral assays. Many questions related to CTE development, however, remain unanswered. These include the role of impact severity, the time interval between impacts, the age at which impacts occur, and the total number of impacts sustained. Other important variables such as the location of impacts, character of impacts, and effect of environment/lifestyle and genetics also warrant further study. In this work, we attempt to address some of these questions by exploring work previously completed using single- and repetitive-injury paradigms. Despite some models producing some deficits similar to CTE symptoms, it is clear that further studies are required to understand the development of neuropathological and neurobehavioral features consistent with CTE-like features in rodents. Specifically, acute and chronic studies are needed that characterize the development of tau-based pathology.  "
2015-10-01,"Chronic neurodegeneration following a history of neurotrauma is frequently associated with neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms. In order to enhance understanding about the underlying pathophysiology linking neurotrauma to neurodegeneration, a multi-model preclinical approach must be established to account for the different injury paradigms and pathophysiologic mechanisms. We investigated the development of tau pathology and behavioral changes using a multi-model and multi-institutional approach, comparing the preclinical results to tauopathy patterns seen in post-mortem human samples from athletes diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We utilized a scaled and validated blast-induced traumatic brain injury model in rats and a modified pneumatic closed-head impact model in mice. Tau hyperphosphorylation was evaluated by western blot and immunohistochemistry. Elevated-plus maze and Morris water maze were employed to measure impulsive-like behavior and cognitive deficits respectively. Animals exposed to single blast (~50 PSI reflected peak overpressure) exhibited elevated AT8 immunoreactivity in the contralateral hippocampus at 1 month compared to controls (q = 3.96, p < 0.05). Animals exposed to repeat blast (six blasts over 2 weeks) had increased AT8 (q = 8.12, p < 0.001) and AT270 (q = 4.03, p < 0.05) in the contralateral hippocampus at 1 month post-injury compared to controls. In the modified controlled closed-head impact mouse model, no significant difference in AT8 was seen at 7 days, however a significant elevation was detected at 1 month following injury in the ipsilateral hippocampus compared to control (q = 4.34, p < 0.05). Elevated-plus maze data revealed that rats exposed to single blast (q = 3.53, p < 0.05) and repeat blast (q = 4.21, p < 0.05) spent more time in seconds exploring the open arms compared to controls. Morris water maze testing revealed a significant difference between groups in acquisition times on days 22-27. During the probe trial, single blast (t = 6.44, p < 0.05) and repeat blast (t = 8.00, p < 0.05) rats spent less time in seconds exploring where the platform had been located compared to controls. This study provides a multi-model example of replicating tau and behavioral changes in animals and provides a foundation for future investigation of CTE disease pathophysiology and therapeutic development.

2015-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegeneration associated with repetitive head impacts. Understanding Neurologic Injury and Traumatic Encephalopathy (UNITE) is a U01 project recently funded by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering. The goal of the UNITE project is to examine the neuropathology and clinical presentation of brain donors designated as ""at risk"" for the development of CTE based on prior athletic or military exposure. Here, we present the rationale and methodology for UNITE. Over the course of 4 years, we will analyze the brains and spinal cords of 300 deceased subjects who had a history of repetitive head impacts sustained during participation in contact sports at the professional or collegiate level or during military service. Clinical data are collected through medical record review and retrospective structured and unstructured family interviews conducted by a behavioral neurologist or neuropsychologist. Blinded to the clinical data, a neuropathologist conducts a comprehensive assessment for neurodegenerative disease, including CTE, using published criteria. At a clinicopathological conference, a panel of physicians and neuropsychologists, blinded to the neuropathological data, reaches a clinical consensus diagnosis using published criteria, including proposed clinical research criteria for CTE. We will investigate the validity of these clinical criteria and sources of error by using recently validated neuropathological criteria as a gold standard for CTE diagnosis. We also will use statistical modeling to identify diagnostic features that best predict CTE pathology. The UNITE study is a novel and methodologically rigorous means of assessing clinicopathological correlation in CTE. Our findings will be critical for developing future iterations of CTE clinical diagnostic criteria. "
2015-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in military life. Interest in military TBI has increased recently due to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Certain types of TBI are relatively unique to the military, the most prominent being blast-related TBI. Blast-related mild TBI has been of particular concern in veterans from the most recent conflicts although controversy remains concerning its separation from post-traumatic stress disorder. TBI is also a risk factor for the later development of neurodegenerative diseases in which cognitive impairment is prominent putting veterans at risk for disorders including Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Recent evidence associating TBI with chronic cognitive impairment is reviewed in the context of its relevance to military veterans.  "
2015-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs in association with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. It is associated with a variety of clinical symptoms in multiple domains, and there is a distinct pattern of pathological changes. The abnormal tau pathology in CTE occurs uniquely in those regions of the brain that are likely most susceptible to stress concentration during trauma. CTE has been associated with a variety of types of repetitive head trauma, most frequently contact sports. In cases published to date, the mean length of exposure to repetitive head trauma was 15.4 years. The clinical symptoms of the disease began after a mean latency of 14.5 years with a mean age of death of 59.3 years. Most subjects had a reported history of concussions with a mean of 20.3. However, 16 % of published CTE subjects did not have a history of concussion suggesting that subconcussive hits are sufficient to lead to the development of CTE. Overall, the number of years of exposure, not the number of concussions, was significantly associated with worse tau pathology in CTE. This suggests that it is the chronic and repetitive nature of head trauma, irrespective of concussive symptoms, that is the most important driver of disease. CTE and exposure to repetitive head trauma is also associated with a variety of other neurodegenerations, including Alzheimer disease. In fact, amyloid β peptide deposition is altered and accelerated in CTE and is associated with worse disease. Here, we review the current exposure, clinical, and pathological associations of CTE. "
2019-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) represents a significant public health problem in modern societies. It is primarily a consequence of traffic-related accidents and falls. Other recently recognized causes include sports injuries and indirect forces such as shock waves from battlefield explosions. TBI is an important cause of death and lifelong disability and represents the most well-established environmental risk factor for dementia. With the growing recognition that even mild head injury can lead to neurocognitive deficits, imaging of brain injury has assumed greater importance. However, there is no single imaging modality capable of characterizing TBI. Current advances, particularly in MR imaging, enable visualization and quantification of structural and functional brain changes not hitherto possible. In this review, we summarize data linking TBI with dementia, emphasizing the imaging techniques currently available in clinical practice along with some advances in medical knowledge. O traumatismo cranioencefálico (TCE) representa um importante problema de saúde pública nas sociedades modernas. As suas principais causas são: os acidentes de trânsito e as quedas. O traumatismo leve e repetido relacionado com os esportes de contato ou o traumatismo relacionado com as ondas de choque provenientes de explosões em cenário de guerra são hoje reconhecidas como importantes causas de TCE. A mortalidade e morbilidade associada ao TCE é considerável. TCE representa o fator de risco ambiental melhor reconhecido para o desenvolvimento de demência. Com o reconhecimento recente de que até o TCE leve pode determinar déficts cognitivos, os estudos de imagem adquiriram grande importância neste contexto. Contudo, não está definido qual o melhor estudo de imagem para caracterizar o TCE. Avanços tecnológicos, como a ressonância magnética, permitem atualmente identificar e quantificar alterações intra-parenquimatosas estruturais e funcionais, não detectáveis nos estudos convencionais. Neste artigo os autores resumem os estudos que relacionam TCE e demência, dando particular ênfase às técnicas de imagem atualmente disponíveis na prática clínica, bem como alguns avanços nos métodos de imagem ainda limitados ao plano da investigação.

2015-10-01,"Approximately one-third of military personnel who deploy for combat operations sustain 1 or more traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), which increases the risk for chronic symptoms of postconcussive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression and for the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Elevated concentrations of tau are observed in blood shortly following a TBI, but, to our knowledge, the role of tau elevations in blood in the onset and maintenance of chronic symptoms after TBI has not been investigated. To assess peripheral tau levels in military personnel exposed to TBI and to examine the relationship between chronic neurological symptoms and tau elevations. Observational assessment from September 2012 to August 2014 of US military personnel at the Madigan Army Medical Center who had been deployed within the previous 18 months. Plasma total tau concentrations were measured using a novel ultrasensitive single-molecule enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Classification of participants with and without self-reported TBI was made using the Warrior Administered Retrospective Casualty Assessment Tool. Self-reported symptoms of postconcussive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression were determined by the Neurobehavioral Symptom Inventory, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Military Version, and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, respectively. Group differences in tau concentrations were determined through analysis of variance models, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve determined the sensitivity and specificity of tau concentrations in predicting TBI and chronic symptoms. Seventy participants with self-reported TBI on the Warrior Administered Retrospective Casualty Assessment Tool and 28 control participants with no TBI exposure were included. Concentration of total tau in peripheral blood. Concentrations of plasma tau were significantly elevated in the 70 participants with self-reported TBI compared with the 28 controls (mean [SD], 1.13 [0.78] vs 0.63 [0.48] pg/mL, respectively; F1,97 = 4.97; P = .03). Within the self-reported TBI cases, plasma total tau concentrations were significantly associated with having a medical record of TBI compared with self-reported TBI only (mean [SD], 1.57 [0.92] vs 0.85 [0.52] pg/mL, respectively; F1,69 = 6.15; P = .02) as well as reporting the occurrence of 3 of more TBIs during deployment compared with fewer than 3 TBIs (mean [SD], 1.52 [0.82] vs 0.82 [0.60] pg/mL, respectively; F1,69 = 8.57; P = .008). The severity of total postconcussive symptoms correlated with total tau concentrations in the self-reported TBI group (r = 0.37; P = .003). Military personnel who report multiple TBIs have long-term elevations in total tau concentration. The total tau concentration relates to symptoms of postconcussive disorder. "
2015-09-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been increasingly accepted as a major external risk factor for neurodegenerative morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence indicates that the resultant chronic neurobiological sequelae following head trauma may, at least in part, contribute to a pathologically distinct disease known as Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The clinical manifestation of CTE is variable, but the symptoms of this progressive disease include impaired memory and cognition, affective disorders (i.e., impulsivity, aggression, depression, suicidality, etc.), and diminished motor control. Notably, mounting evidence suggests that the pathology contributing to CTE may be caused by repetitive exposure to subconcussive hits to the head, even in those with no history of a clinically evident head injury. Given the millions of athletes and military personnel with potential exposure to repetitive subconcussive insults and TBI, CTE represents an important public health issue. However, the incidence rates and pathological mechanisms are still largely unknown, primarily due to the fact that there is no in vivo diagnostic tool. The primary objective of this manuscript is to address this limitation and discuss potential neuroimaging modalities that may be capable of diagnosing CTE in vivo through the detection of tau and other known pathological features. Additionally, we will discuss the challenges of TBI research, outline the known pathology of CTE (with an emphasis on Tau), review current neuroimaging modalities to assess the potential routes for in vivo diagnosis, and discuss the future directions of CTE research.

2016-03-01,"A subset of traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients exhibit cognitive deficits later in life which may be due to the underlying pathology associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The similarities between chronic traumatic encephalopathy and AD merit investigation of potentially similar mechanisms underlying the two diseases. Experimental and clinical studies of AD brains have revealed that insulin resistance links metabolic dysfunction to the neurodegeneration and cognitive deficits associated with AD. Recent work in experimental TBI has established that recovery is dependent on the return of normal brain metabolism and mounting evidence for a role of brain insulin in regulating central metabolism suggests that TBI, like AD, results in central insulin resistance. Here, we review the converging evidence from AD, TBI and diabetes research linking insulin insensitivity to neurodegeneration. "
2015-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been described in the literature as a neurodegenerative disease with: (i) localized neuronal and glial accumulations of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) involving perivascular areas of the cerebral cortex, sulcal depths, and with a preference for neurons within superficial cortical laminae; (ii) multifocal axonal varicosities and axonal loss involving deep cortex and subcortical white matter; (iii) relative absence of beta-amyloid deposits; (iv) TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusions and neurites; and (v) broad and diverse clinical features. Some of the pathological findings reported in the literature may be encountered with age and other neurodegenerative diseases. However, the focality of the p-tau cortical findings in particular, and the regional distribution, are believed to be unique to CTE. The described clinical features in recent cases are very similar to how depression manifests in middle-aged men and with frontotemporal dementia as the disease progresses. It has not been established that the described tau pathology, especially in small amounts, can cause complex changes in behavior such as depression, substance abuse, suicidality, personality changes, or cognitive impairment. Future studies will help determine the extent to which the neuropathology is causally related to the diverse clinical features.  "

Guidelines for the evaluation and treatment of these patients are sparse. Clinical criteria for a diagnosis of CTE are under development. The contribution of CTE vs other neuropathologies to neurobehavioral symptoms in these players remains unclear. Here we describe the experience of our academic memory clinic in evaluating and treating a series of 14 self-referred symptomatic players. Our aim is to raise awareness in the neurology community regarding the different clinical phenotypes, idiosyncratic but potentially treatable symptoms, and the spectrum of underlying neuropathologies in these players.

2015-08-01,"Concussion is a complex brain injury that results in more than 100,000 emergency department visits for school-aged children each year in the United States. All 50 US states have passed concussion legislation designed to promote safety in youth sports. Most of these laws require medical clearance by a licensed health care provider before returning to sport, which may have contributed to an increase in pediatric subspecialty referrals, particularly referrals to the child neurologist. We reviewed the literature on pediatric concussion. This review summarizes the current knowledge and recommendations for concussion diagnosis and management in children and adolescents, athletes and nonathletes. It highlights concussion epidemiology, pathophysiology, advances in neuroimaging, and potential health risks including second impact syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It also underscores clinical areas where evidence is lacking. The diagnosis and management of concussion requires specific considerations in children. Further concussion research must be done to minimize injury risk and to optimize medical care for this common problem. "
2015-07-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI), characterized by acute neurological dysfunction, is one of the best known environmental risk factors for chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease, the defining pathologic features of which include tauopathy made of phosphorylated tau protein (P-tau). However, tauopathy has not been detected in the early stages after TBI, and how TBI leads to tauopathy is unknown. Here we find robust cis P-tau pathology after TBI in humans and mice. After TBI in mice and stress in vitro, neurons acutely produce cis P-tau, which disrupts axonal microtubule networks and mitochondrial transport, spreads to other neurons, and leads to apoptosis. This process, which we term 'cistauosis', appears long before other tauopathy. Treating TBI mice with cis antibody blocks cistauosis, prevents tauopathy development and spread, and restores many TBI-related structural and functional sequelae. Thus, cis P-tau is a major early driver of disease after TBI and leads to tauopathy in chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Alzheimer's disease. The cis antibody may be further developed to detect and treat TBI, and prevent progressive neurodegeneration after injury.  "
2015-07-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. It is defined pathologically by the abnormal accumulation of tau in a unique pattern that is distinct from other tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although trauma has been suggested to increase amyloid β peptide (Aβ) levels, the extent of Aβ deposition in CTE has not been thoroughly characterized. We studied a heterogeneous cohort of deceased athletes and military veterans with neuropathologically diagnosed CTE (n = 114, mean age at death = 60) to test the hypothesis that Aβ deposition is altered in CTE and associated with more severe pathology and worse clinical outcomes. We found that Aβ deposition, either as diffuse or neuritic plaques, was present in 52 % of CTE subjects. Moreover, Aβ deposition in CTE occurred at an accelerated rate and with altered dynamics in CTE compared to a normal aging population (OR = 3.8, p < 0.001). We also found a clear pathological and clinical dichotomy between those CTE cases with Aβ plaques and those without. Aβ deposition was significantly associated with the presence of the APOE ε4 allele (p = 0.035), older age at symptom onset (p < 0.001), and older age at death (p < 0.001). In addition, when controlling for age, neuritic plaques were significantly associated with increased CTE tauopathy stage (β = 2.43, p = 0.018), co-morbid Lewy body disease (OR = 5.01, p = 0.009), and dementia (OR = 4.45, p = 0.012). A subset of subjects met the diagnostic criteria for both CTE and AD, and in these subjects both Aβ plaques and total levels of Aβ1-40 were increased at the depths of the cortical sulcus compared to the gyral crests. Overall, these findings suggest that Aβ deposition is altered and accelerated in a cohort of CTE subjects compared to normal aging and that Aβ is associated with both pathological and clinical progression of CTE independent of age.

2015-05-01,"A 59-year-old man, ex-professional boxer, met clinical criteria for probable Alzheimer's disease. The patient agreed to be included in a clinico-pathological study with donation to the brain bank, and he died at 71. The brain was grossly atrophic, with a prominent atrophy of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, and with pallor of the substantia nigra. Immunohistochemistry with anti-τ A4 revealed abundant and diffuse deposits in the neo-cortex, whereas amyloid angiopathy was absent. Coupled anti-τ AT8 immunohistochemistry and Congo red staining showed no neuritic plaques. τ-AT8-positive glial tangles and neurofibrillary tangles involved preferentially the superficial cortical layers, and were irregularly concentrated in the depth of cortical sulci and near vessels. Neurofibrillary degeneration was marked in amygdala, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and locus ceruleus. Enlarged and/or distorted axons were numerous in hippocampus and mid-brain. TDP 43-positive neuronal inclusions were numerous in amygdala and hippocampus. There was no synucleinopathy. These observations are in accordance with the previously reported data on chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The discussion is focused on professional boxing as it becomes evident that repetitive trauma on the brain provokes the deposition of abnormal proteins involved in neurodegeneration.  "
2015-06-01,"Single and repeated sports-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also referred to as concussion, can result in chronic post-concussive syndrome (PCS), neuropsychological and cognitive deficits, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However PCS is often difficult to diagnose using routine clinical, neuroimaging or laboratory evaluations, while CTE currently only can be definitively diagnosed postmortem. We sought to develop an animal model to simulate human repetitive concussive head injury for systematic study. In this study, mice received single or multiple head impacts by a stereotaxic impact device with a custom-made rubber tip-fitted impactor. Dynamic changes in MRI, neurobiochemical markers (Tau hyperphosphorylation and glia activation in brain tissues) and neurobehavioral functions such as anxiety, depression, motor function and cognitive function at various acute/subacute (1-7 day post-injury) and chronic (14-60 days post-injury) time points were examined. To explore the potential biomarkers of rCHI, serum levels of total Tau (T-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (P-Tau) were also monitored at various time points. Our results show temporal dynamics of MRI consistent with structural perturbation in the acute phase and neurobiochemical changes (P-Tau and GFAP induction) in the subacute and chronic phase as well as development of chronic neurobehavioral changes, which resemble those observed in mTBI patients.

2015-06-01,"Accumulation of phosphorylated tau (p-tau) is accepted by many as a long-term consequence of repetitive mild neurotrauma based largely on brain findings in boxers (dementia pugilistica) and, more recently, former professional athletes, military service members, and others exposed to repetitive head trauma. The pathogenic construct is also largely accepted and suggests that repetitive head trauma (typically concussions or subconcussive forces) acts on brain parenchyma to produce a deleterious neuroinflammatory cascade, encompassing p-tau templating, transsynaptic neurotoxicity, progressive neurodegenerative disease, and associated clinical features. Some caution before accepting these concepts and assumptions is warranted, however. The association between the history of concussion and findings of p-tau at autopsy is unclear. Concussions and subconcussive head trauma exposure are poorly defined in available cases, and the clinical features reported in chronic traumatic encephalopathy are not at present distinguishable from other disorders. Because control groups are limited, the idea that p-tau drives the disease process via protein templating or some other mechanism is preliminary. Much additional research in chronic traumatic encephalopathy is needed to determine if it has unique neuropathology and clinical features, the extent to which the neuropathologic alterations cause the clinical features, and whether it can be identified accurately in a living person.

2015-06-01,"Patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) show loss of central white matter, central gray matter, and cortical gray matter with increasing post-traumatic survival. The majority of experimental studies using animals have, however, discussed only the ultrastructural pathophysiology of injured central white matter leading to secondary axotomy and the formation of axonal terminal bulbs. Using the stretch-injured optic nerve model in adult guinea pigs, the present study provides novel quantitative data concerning Wallerian degeneration of disconnected axonal fragments following secondary axotomy out to 12 weeks after injury to an optic nerve. The time course of Wallerian degeneration at the level of an individual nerve fiber is comparable to that reported in earlier studies over 48 h to two weeks after secondary axotomy. But only a relatively small proportion of nerve fibers within the optic tract degenerate via Wallerian degeneration during the first two weeks. Rather, examples of each of the three stages of Wallerian degeneration-acute axonal degeneration, latency of the distal axonal segment, and granular fragmentation-occur within the optic tract across the entire experimental survival of 12 weeks used in the present study. This data suggests that some nerve fibers initiate Wallerian degeneration days and weeks after the initial time of mechanical injury to an optic nerve. The number of intact nerve fibers continues to fall over at least three months after injury in the stretch-injury model of traumatic axonal injury. It is suggested that these novel findings relate to the mechanism(s) whereby central white matter volume decreases over months and years in CTE patients.  "
2015-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been in the medical literature since the 1920s. It is characterized clinically by diverse neuropsychiatric symptoms, and pathologically by variable degrees of phosphorylated tau accumulation in the brain. The evolving paradigm for the pathogenesis of CTE suggests that concussion or subconcussion from athletic participation initiates a cascade of pathologic events, encompassing neuroinflammation and protein templating with trans-synaptic neurotoxicity. The end result is neurologic and neurobehavioral deterioration, often with self-harm. Although these concepts warrant further investigation, the available evidence permits no conclusions as regards the pathogenesis of the reported findings. Investigations into the role of premorbid or co-morbid neurodegenerative diseases has been limited to date, and in-depth genetic analyses have not been performed. The role of concussion or subconcussion if any, whether and how the condition progresses over time, the extent of phosphorylated tau in clinically normal athletes, the role of phosphorylated tau as a toxic species versus an inert disease response, and whether protein templating has any in vivo relevance remain to be elucidated.

2015-06-01,"Neurodegeneration in bipolar disorder (BPD) is poorly understood. Therefore, the current study was designed to assess the immunohistochemical changes in neurodegenerative markers in patients with BPD. Eleven consecutive autopsy cases diagnosed with BPD were analyzed. Sections were obtained from archival paraffin blocks of representative areas and stained using conventional methods, as well as immunostained with several antibodies to screen for neurodegenerative diseases. Age- and non-argyrophilic grains (AGs) degeneration matched controls were selected for each case. Clinical information was retrospectively collected from medical charts. All patients were men, and the average age of death was 70 years. Neuropathological diagnoses included dementia with grains (2), argyrophilic grain disease (2), corticobasal degeneration (CBD, 1), Lewy body disease (1), hypoxic encephalopathy (1) and cerebral infarction (1). All cases showed AGs to various degrees. Three patients died in their 50s; one demonstrated dementia with Lewy bodies, while the other two showed abundant AGs in the thalamus and amygdala. Of the three patients who died in their 60s, one showed AGs preferentially in the thalamus and amygdala, while the others demonstrated limbic predominance. The patients who died in/after their 70s demonstrated AGs similar to controls, except for the patient with CBD. Our data provides potentiality that neurodegenerative diseases may be an underlying pathology in certain cases of BPD.  "
2015-06-01,"The recent interest in concussion in sport has resulted in significant media focus about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), although a direct causative link(s) between concussion and CTE is not established. Typically, sport-related CTE occurs in a retired athlete with or without a history of concussion(s) who presents with a constellation of cognitive, mood, and/or behavioral symptoms and who has postmortem findings of tau deposition within the brain. There are many confounding variables, however, that can account for brain tau deposition, including genetic mutations, drugs, normal aging, environmental factors, postmortem brain processing, and toxins. To understand the roles of such factors in neurodegenerative diseases that may occur in athletes, this article reviews some neurodegenerative diseases that may present with similar findings in nonathletes. The article also reviews pathological changes identified with normal aging, and reviews the pathological findings of CTE in light of all these factors. While many of these athletes have a history of exposure to head impacts as a part of contact sport, there is insufficient evidence to establish causation between sports concussion and CTE. It is likely that many of the cases with neuropathological findings represent the normal aging process, the effects of opiate abuse, or a variant of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Whether particular genetic causes may place athletes at greater risk of neurodegenerative disease is yet to be determined.  "
2015-05-01,"Over the past decade, athletic-related chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has garnered a great deal of attention in the popular press and, more recently, in the scientific press. With increasing frequency, sports medicine practitioners and providers are faced with questions from the parents of high school football players about CTE and the risk posed to children who participate in this or other contact or collision sports. The purpose of this review was to summarize the research on CTE in an attempt to provide some evidence-based answers to frequently asked questions in clinics from parents. Addressed are (1) the definitions of CTE and its symptoms, (2) the evidence for CTE in football, (3) abnormal tau protein, (4) the use of neuroimaging in CTE diagnosis, (5) risk for CTE, (6) CTE diagnosis in youth, (7) CTE and its relationship to suicide, and (8) contact and collision sports as a risk factor for permanent brain injury or death.

2015-05-01,"Repetitive brain trauma is associated with a progressive neurological deterioration, now termed as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Most instances of CTE occur in association with the play of sports, but CTE has also been reported in association with blast injuries and other neurotrauma. Symptoms of CTE include behavioral and mood changes, memory loss, cognitive impairment and dementia. Like many other neurodegenerative diseases, CTE is diagnosed with certainty only by neuropathological examination of brain tissue. CTE is a tauopathy characterized by the deposition of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein as neurofibrillary tangles, astrocytic tangles and neurites in striking clusters around small blood vessels of the cortex, typically at the sulcal depths. Severely affected cases show p-tau pathology throughout the brain. Abnormalities in phosphorylated 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein are found in most cases of CTE; beta-amyloid is identified in 43%, associated with age. Given the importance of sports participation and physical exercise to physical and psychological health as well as disease resilience, it is critical to identify the genetic risk factors for CTE as well as to understand how other variables, such as stress, age at exposure, gender, substance abuse and other exposures, contribute to the development of CTE. "
2015-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease confirmed at postmortem. Those at highest risk are professional athletes who participate in contact sports and military personnel who are exposed to repetitive blast events. All neuropathologically confirmed CTE cases, to date, have had a history of repetitive head impacts. This suggests that repetitive head impacts may be necessary for the initiation of the pathogenetic cascade that, in some cases, leads to CTE. Importantly, while all CTE appears to result from repetitive brain trauma, not all repetitive brain trauma results in CTE. Magnetic resonance imaging has great potential for understanding better the underlying mechanisms of repetitive brain trauma. In this review, we provide an overview of advanced imaging techniques currently used to investigate brain anomalies. We also provide an overview of neuroimaging findings in those exposed to repetitive head impacts in the acute/subacute and chronic phase of injury and in more neurodegenerative phases of injury, as well as in military personnel exposed to repetitive head impacts. Finally, we discuss future directions for research that will likely lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms separating those who recover from repetitive brain trauma vs. those who go on to develop CTE.  "
2015-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a distinct pattern of hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau). Thought to be caused by repetitive concussive and subconcussive injuries, CTE is considered largely preventable. The majority of neuropathologically confirmed cases have occurred in professional contact sport athletes (eg, boxing, football). A recent post-mortem case series has magnified concerns for the public's health following its identification in six high school level athletes. CTE is diagnosed with certainty only following a post-mortem autopsy. Efforts to define the etiology and clinical progression during life are ongoing. The goal of this article is to characterize the clinical concepts associated with short- and long-term effects of repetitive traumatic brain injury, with a special emphasis on new clinical diagnostic criteria for CTE. Utilizing these new diagnostic criteria, two cases of neuropathologically confirmed CTE, one in a professional football player and one in a professional boxer, are reported. Differences in cerebellar pathology in CTE confirmed cases in boxing and football are discussed.  "

2015-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder attributed to repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. The diagnosis in a living individual can be challenging and can be made definitively only at autopsy. The symptoms are often nonspecific and overlap with neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Higher exposure to repetitive head trauma increases the risk of CTE. Genetic risk factors such as presence of an apolipoprotein E ε4 allele may be important. Individuals have varying degrees of cognitive, behavioral, and motor decline. Limitations in the manner in which data have been obtained over the years have led to different clinical descriptions of CTE. At present, there are no biomarkers to assist in the diagnosis. Standard neuroimaging may show nonspecific atrophic changes; however, newer imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) show promise. Neuropsychological testing may be helpful in determining the pattern of cognitive or behavioral decline.  "
2015-05-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability in every developed country in the world and is believed to be a risk factor in the later development of depression, anxiety disorders and neurodegenerative diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Parkinson's Disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). One challenge faced by those who conduct research into TBI is the lack of a verified and validated biomarker that can be used to diagnose TBI or for use as a prognostic variable which can identify those at risk for poor recovery following injury or at risk for neurodegeneration later in life. Neuroimaging continues to hold promise as a TBI biomarker but is limited by a lack of clear relationship between the neuropathology of injury/recovery and the quantitative and image based data that is obtained. Specifically lacking is the data on biochemical and biologic changes that lead to alterations in neuroimaging markers. There are multiple routes towards developing the knowledge required to more definitively link pathology to imaging but the most efficient approach is expanded leveraging of in vivo human blood, serum, and imaging biomarkers with both in vivo and ex vivo animal findings. This review describes the current use and limitations of imaging in TBI including a discussion of currently used animal injury models and the available animal imaging data and extracted markers that hold the greatest promise for helping translate alterations in imaging back to injury pathology. Further, it reviews both the human and animal TBI literature supporting current standards, identifies the remaining voids in the literature, and briefly highlights recent advances in molecular imaging.

2015-05-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs at higher rates among service members than civilians. Explosions from improvised explosive devices and mines are the leading cause of TBI in the military. As such, TBI is frequently accompanied by other injuries, which makes its diagnosis and treatment difficult. In addition to postconcussion symptoms, those who sustain a TBI commonly report chronic pain and posttraumatic stress symptoms. This combination of symptoms is so typical they have been referred to as the ""polytrauma clinical triad"" among injured service members. We explore whether these symptoms discriminate civilian occurrences of TBI from those of service members, as well as the possibility that repeated blast exposure contributes to the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Traumatic Brain Injury'.  "
2015-05-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in boxing and other contact sports. The long term irreversible and progressive aftermath of TBI in boxers depicted as punch drunk syndrome was described almost a century ago and is now widely referred as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The short term sequelae of acute brain injury including subdural haematoma and catastrophic brain injury may lead to death, whereas mild TBI, or concussion, causes functional disturbance and axonal injury rather than gross structural brain damage. Following concussion, symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, reduced attention, amnesia and headache tend to develop acutely but usually resolve within a week or two. Severe concussion can also lead to loss of consciousness. Despite the transient nature of the clinical symptoms, functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, neuropsychological and neurochemical assessments indicate that the disturbance of concussion takes over a month to return to baseline and neuropathological evaluation shows that concussion-induced axonopathy may persist for years. The developing brains in children and adolescents are more susceptible to concussion than adult brain. The mechanism by which acute TBI may lead to the neurodegenerative process of CTE associated with tau hyperphosphorylation and the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) remains speculative. Focal tau-positive NFTs and neurites in close proximity to focal axonal injury and foci of microhaemorrhage and the predilection of CTE-tau pathology for perivascular and subcortical regions suggest that acute TBI-related axonal injury, loss of microvascular integrity, breach of the blood brain barrier, resulting inflammatory cascade and microglia and astrocyte activation are likely to be the basis of the mechanistic link of TBI and CTE. This article provides an overview of the acute and long-term neurological consequences of TBI in sports. Clinical, neuropathological and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Traumatic Brain Injury'.  "
2015-05-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity around the world. Concussive and subconcussive forms of closed-head injury due to impact or blast neurotrauma represent the most common types of TBI in civilian and military settings. It is becoming increasingly evident that TBI can lead to persistent, long-term debilitating effects, and in some cases, progressive neurodegeneration and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The epidemiological literature suggests that a single moderate-to-severe TBI may be associated with accelerated neurodegeneration and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or motor neuron disease. However, the pathologic phenotype of these post-traumatic neurodegenerations is largely unknown and there may be pathobiological differences between post-traumatic disease and the corresponding sporadic disorder. By contrast, the pathology of CTE is increasingly well known and is characterized by a distinctive pattern of progressive brain atrophy and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau neurofibrillary and glial tangles, dystrophic neurites, 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) neuronal and glial aggregates, microvasculopathy, myelinated axonopathy, neuroinflammation, and white matter degeneration. Clinically, CTE is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory deficits, and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and most often progress slowly over decades. Although research on the long-term effects of TBI is advancing quickly, the incidence and prevalence of post-traumatic neurodegeneration and CTE are unknown. Critical knowledge gaps include elucidation of pathogenic mechanisms, identification of genetic risk factors, and clarification of relevant variables-including age at exposure to trauma, history of prior and subsequent head trauma, substance use, gender, stress, and comorbidities-all of which may contribute to risk profiles and the development of post-traumatic neurodegeneration and CTE.

2015-05-01,"Every year an estimated 42 million people worldwide suffer a mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) or concussion. More severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a well-established risk factor for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Recently, large epidemiological studies have additionally identified MTBI as a risk factor for dementia. The role of MTBI in risk of PD or ALS is less well established. Repetitive MTBI and repetitive sub-concussive head trauma have been linked to increased risk for a variety of neurodegenerative diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE is a unique neurodegenerative tauopathy first described in boxers but more recently described in a variety of contact sport athletes, military veterans, and civilians exposed to repetitive MTBI. Studies of repetitive MTBI and CTE have been limited by referral bias, lack of consensus clinical criteria for CTE, challenges of quantifying MTBI exposure, and potential for confounding. The prevalence of CTE is unknown and the amount of MTBI or sub-concussive trauma exposure necessary to produce CTE is unclear. This review will summarize the current literature regarding the epidemiology of MTBI, post-TBI dementia and Parkinson's disease, and CTE while highlighting methodological challenges and critical future directions of research in this field.

2015-05-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs when an external force traumatically injures the brain. Whereas severe TBI can be diagnosed using a combination of clinical signs and standard neuroimaging techniques, mild TBI (also called concussion) is more difficult to detect. This is where fluid markers of injury to different cell types and subcellular compartments in the central nervous system come into play. These markers are often proteins, peptides or other molecules with selective or high expression in the brain, which can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid or blood as they leak out or get secreted in response to the injury. Here, we review the literature on fluid markers of neuronal, axonal and astroglial injury to diagnose mild TBI and to predict clinical outcome in patients with head trauma. We also discuss chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive neurodegenerative disease in individuals with a history of multiple mild TBIs in a biomarker context.

2015-04-01,"To study the effects of head injury on disease progression and on neuropathologic outcomes in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Patients with ALS were surveyed to obtain head injury history, and medical records were reviewed. Linear regression was performed to determine if head injury was a predictor for mean monthly decline of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-revised (ALSFRS-R), while controlling for confounders. Head injury history was obtained from family members of ALS autopsy cases. The frequency of tau proteinopathy, brain TDP-43 inclusions, and pathologic findings of Alzheimer disease (AD) were examined in ALS cases with head injury compared to cases without. Logistic regression was performed with each neuropathologic diagnosis as an outcome measure and head injury as a predictor variable. No difference was seen in rate of decline of the ALSFRS-R between patients with head injury (n = 24) and without (n = 76), with mean monthly decline of -0.9 for both groups (p = 0.18). Of 47 ALS autopsy cases (n = 9 with head injury, n = 38 without), no significant differences were seen in the frequency of tau proteinopathy (11% with head injury; 24% without), TDP-43 in the brain (44% with head injury; 45% without), or AD pathology (33% with head injury; 26% without). Independent logistic regression models showed head injury was not a predictor of tau pathology (p = 0.42) or TDP-43 in the brain (p = 0.99). Head injury was not associated with faster disease progression in ALS and did not result in a specific neuropathologic phenotype. The tau pathology described with chronic traumatic encephalopathy was found in ALS autopsy cases both with and without head injury. "
2015-04-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is an acquired primary tauopathy with a variety of cognitive, behavioral, and motor symptoms linked to cumulative brain damage sustained from single, episodic, or repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI). No definitive clinical diagnosis for this condition exists. In this work, we used [F-18]FDDNP PET to detect brain patterns of neuropathology distribution in retired professional American football players with suspected CTE (n = 14) and compared results with those of cognitively intact controls (n = 28) and patients with Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (n = 24), a disease that has been cognitively associated with CTE. [F-18]FDDNP PET imaging results in the retired players suggested the presence of neuropathological patterns consistent with models of concussion wherein brainstem white matter tracts undergo early axonal damage and cumulative axonal injuries along subcortical, limbic, and cortical brain circuitries supporting mood, emotions, and behavior. This deposition pattern is distinctively different from the progressive pattern of neuropathology [paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and amyloid-β] in AD, which typically begins in the medial temporal lobe progressing along the cortical default mode network, with no or minimal involvement of subcortical structures. This particular [F-18]FDDNP PET imaging pattern in cases of suspected CTE also is primarily consistent with PHF-tau distribution observed at autopsy in subjects with a history of mild TBI and autopsy-confirmed diagnosis of CTE.

2015-04-01,"Baclofen is a centrally acting gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist used for the symptomatic relief of skeletal muscle spasm and spasticity in traumatic spinal cord lesions, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, and stroke. It is also used in the treatment of chronic hiccups and cocaine abuse. Baclofen-induced central nervous system depression is rare at the usual therapeutic doses. However, patients with impaired renal function are at a higher risk of developing baclofen toxicity, even at a lower dose. A 57-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis was admitted to our emergency department with progressive confusion and a generalized decrease in muscular tone. There was no obvious metabolic or infectious etiology that could have explained her condition. A comprehensive laboratory and imaging workup was negative. A review of her medication showed that she had recently been prescribed baclofen for muscular spasm. She was diagnosed with baclofen toxicity and was treated with emergent hemodialysis, which improved her mental status and her decreased muscle tone. Repeated sessions of hemodialysis administered on her second and third days of admission ultimately produced sustained clinical improvement and a complete return to her baseline mental status. She was subsequently discharged home with instructions to stay off baclofen. Baclofen toxicity is an under-diagnosed condition, especially in patients with renal dysfunction. Physicians should consider baclofen toxicity in patients with suboptimal kidney function on baclofen who present with altered mental status. Emergent hemodialysis and intensive care unit monitoring is recommended. "

2015-04-01,"Endocannabinoids (eCBs) are endogenous lipid mediators involved in a variety of physiological, pharmacological, and pathological processes. While activation of the eCB system primarily induces inhibitory effects on both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission and plasticity through acting on presynaptically expressed CB1 receptors in the brain, accumulated information suggests that eCB signaling is also capable of facilitating or potentiating excitatory synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Recent studies show that a long-lasting potentiation of excitatory synaptic transmission at Schaffer collateral (SC)-CA1 synapses is induced by spatiotemporally primed inputs, accompanying with a long-term depression of inhibitory synaptic transmission (I-LTD) in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons. This input timing-dependent long-lasting synaptic potentiation at SC-CA1 synapses is mediated by 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) signaling triggered by activation of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), and a concurrent rise in intracellular Ca(2+). Emerging evidence now also indicates that 2-AG is an important signaling mediator keeping brain homeostasis by exerting its anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects in response to harmful insults through CB1/2 receptor-dependent and/or -independent mechanisms. Activation of the nuclear receptor protein peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ apparently is one of the important mechanisms in resolving neuroinflammation and protecting neurons produced by 2-AG signaling. Thus, the information summarized in this review suggests that the role of eCB signaling in maintaining integrity of brain function is greater than what we thought previously. "

2015-03-01,"The goal was to identify which neurochemicals differ in professional athletes with repetitive brain trauma (RBT) when compared to healthy controls using a relatively new technology, in vivo Localized COrrelated SpectroscopY (L-COSY). To achieve this, L-COSY was used to examine five former professional male athletes with 11 to 28 years of exposure to contact sports. Each athlete who had had multiple symptomatic concussions and repetitive sub concussive trauma during their career was assessed by an experienced neuropsychologist. All athletes had clinical symptoms including headaches, memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, and depression. Five healthy men, age and weight matched to the athlete cohort and with no history of brain trauma, were recruited as controls. Data were collected from the posterior cingulate gyrus using a 3 T clinical magnetic resonance scanner equipped with a 32 channel head coil. The variation of the method was calculated by repeated examination of a healthy control and phantom and found to be 10% and 5%, respectively, or less. The L-COSY measured large and statistically significant differences (P ≤0.05), between healthy controls and those athletes with RBT. Men with RBT showed higher levels of glutamine/glutamate (31%), choline (65%), fucosylated molecules (60%) and phenylalanine (46%). The results were evaluated and the sample size of five found to achieve a significance level P = 0.05 and a power of 90%. Differences in N-acetyl aspartate and myo-inositol between RBT and controls were small and were not statistically significance. A study of a small cohort of professional athletes, with a history of RBT and symptoms of chronic traumatic encephalopathy when compared with healthy controls using 2D L-COSY, showed elevations in brain glutamate/glutamine and choline as recorded previously for early traumatic brain injury. For the first time increases in phenylalanine and fucose are recorded in the brains of athletes with RBT. Larger studies utilizing the L-COSY method may offer an in-life method of diagnosis and personalized approach for monitoring the acute effects of mild traumatic brain injury and the chronic effects of RBT.

2015-03-01,"The concept that frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a purely cortical dementia has largely been refuted by the recognition of its close association with motor neuron disease, and the identification of transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) as a major pathological substrate underlying both diseases. Genetic findings have transformed this field and revealed connections between disorders that were previous thought clinically unrelated. The discovery that the C9ORF72 locus is responsible for the majority of hereditary FTD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and FTD-ALS cases and the understanding that repeat-containing RNA plays a crucial role in pathogenesis of both disorders has paved the way for the development of potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for these devastating diseases. In this review, we summarize the historical aspects leading up to our current understanding of the genetic, clinical, and neuropathological overlap between FTD and ALS, and include brief discussions on chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), given its association with TDP-43 pathology, its associated increased dementia risk, and reports of ALS in CTE patients. In addition, we describe other genetic associations between dementia and neuromuscular disease, such as inclusion body myositis with Paget's disease and FTD.  "

2015-03-01,"Emerging evidence suggests that the risk of developing chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is significantly increased in military personnel and contact sports players who have been exposed to repetitive trauma brain injury (TBI). Unfortunately there are no effective medications currently available for prevention and treatment of CTE. Here we demonstrate that inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the key enzyme that metabolizes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the brain, significantly reduced CTE-like neuropathologic changes in a mouse model of repetitive mild closed head injury (rmCHI). Inhibition of 2-AG metabolism promoted neurologic recovery following rmCHI and reduced proinflammatory cytokines, astroglial reactivity, expression of amyloid precursor protein and the enzymes that make Aβ, as well as formation of Aβ. Importantly, neurodegeneration, TDP-43 protein aggregation, and tau phosphorylation, which are the neuropathologic hallmarks of CTE, were significantly suppressed by MAGL inactivation. Furthermore, alterations in expression of glutamate receptor subunits and impairments in basal synaptic transmission, long-term synaptic plasticity, and spatial learning and memory were recovered by inhibition of 2-AG metabolism in animals exposed to rmCHI. Our results suggest that MAGL inhibition, which boosts 2-AG and reduces 2-AG metabolites prostaglandins in the brain, may lead to a new therapy for CTE.  "

2015-02-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a highly prevalent condition with significant effects on cognition and behavior. While the acute and sub-acute effects of TBI recover over time, relatively little is known about the long-term effects of TBI in relation to neurodegenerative disease. This issue has recently garnered a great deal of attention due to publicity surrounding chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in professional athletes, although CTE is but one of several neurodegenerative disorders associated with a history of TBI. Here, we review the literative on neurodegenerative disorders linked to remote TBI. We also review the evidence for neuroimaging changes associated with unhealthy brain aging in the context of remote TBI. We conclude that neuroimaging biomarkers have significant potential to increase understanding of the mechanisms of unhealthy brain aging and neurodegeneration following TBI, with potential for identifying those at risk for unhealthy brain aging prior to the clinical manifestation of neurodegenerative disease.

2015-02-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with head trauma. Although initially believed to affect only boxers, the at-risk population has expanded to encompass a much wider demographic, including American football players, hockey players, wrestlers, and military veterans. This expansion has garnered considerable media attention and public concern for the potential neurodegenerative effects of head trauma. The main aim of this systematic review is to give a complete overview of the common findings and risk factors for CTE as well as the status quo regarding the incidence and prevalence of CTE. This systematic review was performed using PubMed and MEDLINE and includes all neuropathologically confirmed cases of CTE in the medical literature to date, from the first published case in 1954 to August 1, 2013 (n = 153). The demographics, including the primary source of mTBI (mild Traumatic Brain Injury), age and cause of death, ApoE genotype, and history of substance abuse, when listed, were obtained from each case report. The demographics of American football players found to have CTE are also presented separately in order to highlight the most prevalent group of CTE cases reported in recent years. These 153 case reports of CTE represent the largest collection to date. We found that a history of mTBI was the only risk factor consistently associated with CTE. In addition, we found no relationships between CTE and age of death or abnormal ApoE allele. Suicide and the presence of premorbid dementia was not strongly associated with CTE. We conclude that the incidence of CTE remains unknown due to the lack of large, longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the neuropathological and clinical findings related to CTE overlap with many common neurodegenerative diseases. Our review reveals significant limitations of the current CTE case reporting and questions the widespread existence of CTE in contact sports.  "
2015-02-01,"There are growing concerns about potential delayed, neuropsychiatric consequences (e.g, cognitive decline, mood or anxiety disorders) of sports-related traumatic brain injury (TBI). Autopsy studies of brains from a limited number of former athletes have described characteristic, pathologic changes of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) leading to questions about the relationship between these pathologic and the neuropsychiatric disturbances seen in former athletes. Research in this area will depend on in vivo methods that characterize molecular changes in the brain, linking CTE and other sports-related pathologies with delayed emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms. In this pilot project we studied former National Football League (NFL) players using new neuroimaging techniques and clinical measures of cognitive functioning. We hypothesized that former NFL players would show molecular and structural changes in medial temporal and parietal lobe structures as well as specific cognitive deficits, namely those of verbal learning and memory. We observed a significant increase in binding of [(11)C]DPA-713 to the translocator protein (TSPO), a marker of brain injury and repair, in several brain regions, such as the supramarginal gyrus and right amygdala, in 9 former NFL players compared to 9 age-matched, healthy controls. We also observed significant atrophy of the right hippocampus. Finally, we report that these same former players had varied performance on a test of verbal learning and memory, suggesting that these molecular and pathologic changes may play a role in cognitive decline. These results suggest that localized brain injury and repair, indicated by increased [(11)C]DPA-713 binding to TSPO, may be linked to history of NFL play. [(11)C]DPA-713 PET is a promising new tool that can be used in future study design to examine further the relationship between TSPO expression in brain injury and repair, selective regional brain atrophy, and the potential link to deficits in verbal learning and memory after NFL play.

2015-02-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that develops as a result of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is characterized by a unique pattern of accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurons and astrocytes. The tau abnormalities begin focally and perivascularly at the depths of the cerebral sulci, spread to the superficial layers of the adjacent cortex, and eventually become widespread throughout the medial temporal lobes, diencephalon, and brainstem. Abnormalities in 43 kDa TAR DNA-binding protein are also found in most cases of CTE. To date, CTE can only be diagnosed by postmortem neuropathological examination, although there are many ongoing research studies examining imaging techniques and biomarkers that might prove to have diagnostic utility. Currently, the incidence and prevalence of CTE are unknown, although great strides are being made to better understand the clinical symptoms and signs of CTE. Further research is critically needed to better identify the genetic and environmental risk factors for CTE as well as potential rehabilitation and therapeutic strategies.  "
2015-01-01,"Intracellular Tau inclusions are a pathological hallmark of several neurodegenerative diseases, collectively known as the tauopathies. They include Alzheimer disease, tangle-only dementia, Pick disease, argyrophilic grain disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal degeneration. Tau pathology appears to spread through intercellular propagation, requiring the formation of assembled ""prion-like"" species. Several cell and animal models have been described that recapitulate aspects of this phenomenon. However, the molecular characteristics of seed-competent Tau remain unclear. Here, we have used a cell model to understand the relationships between Tau structure/phosphorylation and seeding by aggregated Tau species from the brains of mice transgenic for human mutant P301S Tau and full-length aggregated recombinant P301S Tau. Deletion of motifs (275)VQIINK(280) and (306)VQIVYK(311) abolished the seeding activity of recombinant full-length Tau, suggesting that its aggregation was necessary for seeding. We describe conformational differences between native and synthetic Tau aggregates that may account for the higher seeding activity of native assembled Tau. When added to aggregated Tau seeds from the brains of mice transgenic for P301S Tau, soluble recombinant Tau aggregated and acquired the molecular properties of aggregated Tau from transgenic mouse brain. We show that seeding is conferred by aggregated Tau that enters cells through macropinocytosis and seeds the assembly of endogenous Tau into filaments.  "
2015-01-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been a common cause of morbidity and mortality throughout history, but has had interesting twists in the industrial era and in the world of aggressive sports or modern warfare. The American public is especially troubled by the problem of hundreds of thousands of injured veterans returning from the lengthy post-9/11 campaigns and is also fearful that repeat concussions experienced in contact sports played by millions of young athletes may result in progressive neurodegenerative disease and dementia. The problem of traumatic degeneration, termed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), has been long recognized in the world of boxing, but has recently come to the forefront because of several highly publicized deaths of popular NFL protagonists. Despite extensive publicity, the real risk of CTE among amateur and professional players has not been measured or adequately characterized and notions derived from autopsy studies, although useful for understanding mechanisms, cannot give an accurate picture of the range of outcomes after repeat concussions and are limited because of ascertainment bias. It is imperative that prospective studies are designed and deployed to the problem, but such approaches will take a long time to bear fruits in view of the long incubation time of key pathologies. Meanwhile, emphasis on molecular and cellular mechanisms of deposition of a key protein, the microtubule-associated protein tau, as well as the construction of relevant animal models, may help define cause-and-effect relationships, shed light into mechanisms, and generate ideas about biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Imports from extensive work in other degenerative tauopathies such as frontotemporal degeneration may greatly facilitate innovation in this area. "
2015-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease that is most often identified in postmortem autopsies of individuals exposed to repetitive head impacts, such as boxers and football players. The neuropathology of CTE is characterized by the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in a pattern that is unique from that of other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. The clinical features of CTE are often progressive, leading to dramatic changes in mood, behavior, and cognition, frequently resulting in debilitating dementia. In some cases, motor features, including parkinsonism, can also be present. In this review, the historical origins of CTE are revealed and an overview of the current state of knowledge of CTE is provided, including the neuropathology, clinical features, proposed clinical and pathological diagnostic criteria, potential in vivo biomarkers, known risk factors, and treatment options.

2016-10-01,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with repetitive brain trauma (RBT). Initially described in boxers, CTE has now been found in other contact sport athletes with a history of RBT. In recent years, there has been tremendous media attention regarding CTE, primarily because of the deaths of high profile American football players who were found to have CTE upon neuropathological examination. However, the study of CTE remains in its infancy. This review focuses on research from the Centre for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CSTE) at Boston University. This study reviews the formation of the CSTE, major CSTE publications and current ongoing research projects at the CSTE. The neuropathology of CTE has been well-described. Current research focuses on: methods of diagnosing the disease during life (including the development of biomarkers), examination of CTE risk factors (including genetic susceptibility and head impact exposure variables); description of the clinical presentation of CTE; development of research diagnostic criteria for Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome; and assessment of mechanism and pathogenesis. Current research at the BU CSTE is aimed at increasing understanding of the long-term consequences of repetitive head impacts and attempting to begin to answer several of the unanswered questions regarding CTE.

2014-10-01,"The purposes of this paper are to review: (1) the history of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in sports, (2) the similarities and differences between historic and current definitions of CTE, (3) recent epidemiology and cohort studies of CTE and (4) controversies regarding the current CTE positions. Not applicable. Selective review of published articles relevant to CTE. The current definitions of CTE have evolved from its original definition and now rely heavily on the post-mortem detection of hyperphosphorylated tau for diagnosis. As of 2013, there is a blended cohort of 110 professional athletes diagnosed with CTE. It is being assumed that concussions and/or sub-concussive impacts in contact sports are the sole cause of CTE. There are multiple causes of abnormal tau protein deposition in the human brain and the pathogenesis of CTE may not be related solely to concussion and/or sub-concussive injury. In all likelihood, the causes of CTE are a multivariate, as opposed to a univariate, phenomenon. "
2014-10-01,"Current characterizations of chronic traumatic brain injury (CTBI) in boxing, football and other sports are reviewed in the context of the history of research on sub-concussive brain trauma in athletes. The utility of exposure models for understanding CTBI in boxers is examined and concerns regarding the paucity of findings supportive of an exposure model for CTBI in football players are discussed. Recommendations for development of exposure models for sport-specific phenotypic characterizations of CTBI are presented. "
2018-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity, is divided into three grades of severity: mild, moderate, and severe, based on the Glasgow Coma Scale, the loss of consciousness, and the development of post-traumatic amnesia. Although mild traumatic brain injury, including concussion and subconcussion, is by far the most common, it is also the most difficult to diagnose and the least well understood. Proper recognition, management, and treatment of acute concussion and mild traumatic brain injury are the fundamentals of an emerging clinical discipline. It is also becoming increasingly clear that some mild traumatic brain injuries have persistent, and sometimes progressive, long-term debilitating effects. Evidence indicates that a single traumatic brain injury can precipitate or accelerate multiple age-related neurodegenerations, increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron disease, and that repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries can provoke the development of a tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Clinically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory loss, and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and progress slowly over decades. Pathologically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy produces atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, thalamus, and hypothalamus, septal abnormalities, and abnormal deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau (τ) as neurofibrillary tangles and disordered neurites throughout the brain. The incidence and prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the genetic risk factors critical to its development are currently unknown. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy frequently occurs as a sole diagnosis, but may be associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, and motor neuron disease. Currently, chronic traumatic encephalopathy can be diagnosed only at autopsy; however, promising efforts to develop imaging, spinal fluid, and peripheral blood biomarkers are underway to diagnose and monitor the course of disease in living subjects.  "
2015-02-01,"Over the past few decades it has been recognized that traumatic brain injury may result in various movement disorders. In survivors of severe head injury, post-traumatic movement disorders were reported in about 20%, and they persisted in about 10% of patients. The most frequent persisting movement disorder in this population is kinetic cerebellar outflow tremor in about 9%, followed by dystonia in about 4%. While tremor is associated most frequently with cerebellar or mesencephalic lesions, patients with dystonia frequently have basal ganglia or thalamic lesions. Moderate or mild traumatic brain injury only rarely causes persistent post-traumatic movement disorders. It appears that the frequency of post-traumatic movement disorders overall has been declining which most likely is secondary to improved treatment of brain injury. In patients with disabling post-traumatic movement disorders which are refractory to medical treatment, stereotactic neurosurgery can provide long-lasting benefit. While in the past the primary option for severe kinetic tremor was thalamotomy and for dystonia thalamotomy or pallidotomy, today deep brain stimulation has become the preferred treatment. Parkinsonism is a rare consequence of single head injury, but repeated head injury such as seen in boxing can result in chronic encephalopathy with parkinsonian features. While there is still controversy whether or not head injury is a risk factor for the development of Parkinson's disease, recent studies indicate that genetic susceptibility might be relevant.  "
2015-09-01,"Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy represent conditions that have a profound socioeconomic impact for both the individual and the wider community. They are all characterized by specific protein aggregation that results in synaptic dysfunction, neuronal death, and consequent cognitive decline and memory loss. In this review, we present evidence to support the notion that the common pathologies found in all conditions, and indeed their associated cognitive deficits, may be linked by zinc (Zn²⁺) ion dyshomeostasis. Elucidation of this hypothesis may present new therapeutic avenues for these devastating conditions. "
2015-01-01,"Use of selective in-vivo tau imaging will enable improved understanding of tau aggregation in the brain, facilitating research into causes, diagnosis, and treatment of major tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and some variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Neuropathological studies of Alzheimer's disease show a strong association between tau deposits, decreased cognitive function, and neurodegenerative changes. Selective tau imaging will allow the in-vivo exploration of such associations and measure the global and regional changes in tau deposits over time. Such imaging studies will comprise non-invasive assessment of the spatial and temporal pattern of tau deposition over time, providing insight into the role tau plays in ageing and helping to establish the relation between cognition, genotype, neurodegeneration, and other biomarkers. Once validated, selective tau imaging might be useful as a diagnostic, prognostic, and progression biomarker, and a surrogate marker for the monitoring of efficacy and patient recruitment for anti-tau therapeutic trials.  "
2015-01-01,"It has long been suggested that prior traumatic brain injury (TBI) increases the subsequent incidence of chronic neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Among these, the association with Alzheimer disease has the strongest support. There is also a long-recognized association between repeated concussive insults and progressive cognitive decline or other neuropsychiatric abnormalities. The latter was first described in boxers as dementia pugilistica, and has received widespread recent attention in contact sports such as professional American football. The term chronic traumatic encephalopathy was coined to attempt to define a ""specific"" entity marked by neurobehavioral changes and the extensive deposition of phosphorylated tau protein. Nearly lost in the discussions of post-traumatic neurodegeneration after traumatic brain injury has been the role of sustained neuroinflammation, even though this association has been well established pathologically since the 1950s, and is strongly supported by subsequent preclinical and clinical studies. Manifested by extensive microglial and astroglial activation, such chronic traumatic brain inflammation may be the most important cause of post-traumatic neurodegeneration in terms of prevalence. Critically, emerging preclinical studies indicate that persistent neuroinflammation and associated neurodegeneration may be treatable long after the initiating insult(s).  "
2014-12-01,"An animal model of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is essential for further understanding the pathophysiological link between repetitive head injury and the development of chronic neurodegenerative disease. We previously described a model of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) in mice that encapsulates the neurobehavioral spectrum characteristic of patients with CTE. We aimed to study the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this animal model. Our previously described model allows for controlled, closed head impacts to unanesthetized mice. Briefly, 12-week-old mice were divided into three groups: Control, single, and repetitive mTBI. Repetitive mTBI mice received six concussive impacts daily, for 7 days. Mice were then subsequently sacrificed for macro- and micro-histopathologic analysis at 7 days, 1 month, and 6 months after the last TBI received. Brain sections were immunostained for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) for astrocytes, CD68 for activated microglia, and AT8 for phosphorylated tau protein. Brains from single and repetitive mTBI mice lacked macroscopic tissue damage at all time-points. Single mTBI resulted in an acute rea ctive astrocytosis at 7 days and increased phospho-tau immunoreactivity that was present acutely and at 1 month, but was not persistent at 6 months. Repetitive mTBI resulted in a more marked neuroinflammatory response, with persistent and widespread astrogliosis and microglial activation, as well as significantly elevated phospho-tau immunoreactivity to 6-months. The neuropathological findings in this new model of repetitive mTBI resemble some of the histopathological hallmarks of CTE, including increased astrogliosis, microglial activation, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein accumulation. "
2014-12-01,"Growing public health concern exists over the incidence of chronic traumatic brain injury (TBI) in athletes participating in contact sports. Chronic TBI represents a spectrum of disorders associated with long-term consequences of single or repetitive TBI and includes chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), chronic postconcussion syndrome, and chronic neurocognitive impairment. Neurologists should be familiar with the different types of chronic TBI and their diagnostic criteria. CTE is the most severe chronic TBI and represents the neurologic consequences of repetitive mild TBI. It is particularly noted among boxers and football players. CTE presents with behavioral, cognitive, and motor symptoms, and can only be definitively diagnosed postmortem. Chronic postconcussion syndrome is defined as postconcussion symptoms that last longer than 1 year and do not appear to resolve; it may develop after a single concussive event. Chronic neurocognitive impairment is an all-encompassing clinical term denoting long-term neurologic sequelae secondary to sports-related trauma and can present either within the postconcussion syndrome or years after a symptom-free interval. This article discusses the diagnostic evaluation of chronic TBI, including clinical history, neurologic examination, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing, as well as the distinctions between CTE, chronic postconcussion syndrome, and chronic neurocognitive impairment. Neurologic impairment among athletes exposed to repetitive brain injury appears to be a real phenomenon. Because CTE has no established treatment, prevention is of paramount importance for athletes participating in contact sports. "
2014-12-01,"Concussions are a major public health issue, and particularly so in the setting of sports. Millions of athletes of all ages may face the risks of concussion and repeat concussion. This article introduces the terminology, epidemiology, and underlying pathophysiology associated with concussion, focused on sports-related injuries. Concussion is a clinical syndrome of symptoms and signs occurring after biomechanical force is imparted to the brain. Because of the subjective nature of symptom reporting, definitions of concussion differ slightly in different guidelines. Concussion nomenclature also includes mild traumatic brain injury, postconcussion symptoms, postconcussion syndrome, chronic neurocognitive impairment, subconcussive injury, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Between 1.6 and 3.8 million sports-related concussions are estimated in the United States annually, particularly in youth athletes. Rates of concussion are higher in sports such as football, rugby, ice hockey, and wrestling in males, and soccer and basketball in females. The underlying pathophysiology of concussion centers on membrane leakage, ionic flux, indiscriminate glutamate release, and energy crisis. These initial events then trigger ongoing metabolic impairment, vulnerability to second injury, altered neural activation, and axonal dysfunction. While the linkage between acute neurobiology and chronic deficits remains to be elucidated, activation of cell death pathways, ongoing inflammation, persistent metabolic problems, and accumulation of abnormal or toxic proteins have all been implicated. Concussion is a biomechanically induced syndrome of neural dysfunction. Millions of concussions occur annually, many of them related to sports. Biologically, a complex sequence of events occurs from initial ionic flux, glutamate release, and axonal damage, resulting in vulnerability to second injury and possibly to longer-term neurodegeneration. "
2014-12-01,"With the recent increasing interest in outcomes after repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (rmTBI; e.g., sports concussions), several models of rmTBI have been established. Characterizing these models in terms of behavioral and histopathological outcomes is vital to assess their clinical translatability. The purpose of this study is to provide an in-depth behavioral and histopathological phenotype of a clinically relevant model of rmTBI. The authors used a previously published weight-drop model of rmTBI (7 injuries in 9 days) in 2- to 3-month-old mice that produces cognitive deficits without persistent loss of consciousness, seizures, gross structural imaging findings, or microscopic evidence of structural brain damage. Injured and sham-injured (anesthesia only) mice were subjected to a battery of behavioral testing, including tests of balance (rotarod), spatial memory (Morris water maze), anxiety (open field plus maze), and exploratory behavior (hole-board test). After behavioral testing, brains were assessed for histopathological outcomes, including brain volume and microglial and astrocyte immunolabeling. Compared with sham-injured mice, mice subjected to rmTBI showed increased exploratory behavior and had impaired balance and worse spatial memory that persisted up to 3 months after injury. Long-term behavioral deficits were associated with chronic increased astrocytosis and microgliosis but no volume changes. The authors demonstrate that their rmTBI model results in a characteristic behavioral phenotype that correlates with the clinical syndrome of concussion and repetitive concussion. This model offers a platform from which to study therapeutic interventions for rmTBI. "
2014-12-01,"The last decade has witnessed the development and characterization of tracers for the evaluation of neuropathology in vivo. The introduction of these tracers, namely β-amyloid (Aβ) and later tau, are providing the tools to change the landscape and refine our understanding of Aβ and tau deposition in the brain, allowing to investigate the causes, refine diagnosis and improve treatment of major neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Aβ and tau imaging allow examination of the regional and global changes of these disease markers over time as well as their relationship with other relevant parameters such as cognitive performance and neurodegenerative changes. Aβ and tau imaging will enable to establish the role Aβ and tau play -and interplay- in aging and disease. Aβ and tau imaging value resides in being not only diagnostic, prognostic or progression markers, but also surrogate markers of disease, crucial for patient recruitment and efficacy evaluation of disease-specific therapies.

2014-11-01,"Juvenile traumatic brain injury (TBI) leaves survivors facing a potential lifetime of cognitive, somatic and emotional symptoms. A recent study published in Experimental Neurology (Kamper et al., 2013) explored the chronic consequences of focal brain injury induced in the juvenile animal, extending their previous observations out to 6months post-injury. The results demonstrate transient, persistent, and late onset behavioral dysfunction, which are associated with subtle evidence for enduring histopathology. In line with investigations about chronic traumatic encephalopathy from brain injury initiated in the adult, juvenile TBI establishes signs of a chronic brain disorder, with unique considerations relative to ongoing developmental processes. This commentary discusses the challenges in evaluating aging with injury in the juvenile population, the current methods of juvenile TBI, and what can be anticipated for the future of the field.  "

It also examines the effects of perceived coach support on concussion reporting behaviors, finding that greater perceived coach support is associated with fewer undiagnosed concussions and returning to play while symptomatic less frequently in the two weeks preceding the survey. Coaches play a critical role in athlete concussion reporting.  "
2017-05-01,"State concussion laws and sport-league policies are important tools for protecting public health, but also present implementation challenges. Both state laws and league policies often require athletes provide written acknowledgement of having received concussion-related information and/or of their responsibility to report concussion-related symptoms. This paper examines these requirements in two ways: an analysis of the variation in state laws and sport-league policies and a study of their effects in a cohort of collegiate football players.  "
2015-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative syndrome that has been linked to serious psychiatric symptoms, including depression, aggression, and suicidal behavior. This review critically examines the extant research on the behavioral manifestations of CTE and concludes that the paucity of longitudinal prospective studies on CTE, combined with a lack of research-accepted diagnostic criteria for identifying individuals who are considered at risk for CTE, makes it difficult to reliably establish a causal relationship between CTE and the onset of behavioral health problems. Selection and reporting bias and inconsistency in data collection methods are other concerns. To advance the field, there is a critical need for more empirical research on the behavioral manifestations of CTE. Recommendations and intervention models are also discussed.  "
2014-10-01,"At least 300 000 sports-related concussions occur in the United States annually. With millions of American athletes, the long-term effects of repeated concussion or mild traumatic brain injury are an important topic. Unfortunately, there is a lack of strong data on the causality or prevalence of long-term effects among athletes. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative tauopathy, with associated clinical, behavioral, and neuropathological findings, is an important clinical entity in need of further study. Diffusion tensor imaging can elucidate trauma-induced white matter damage, but the diagnosis of CTE cannot be proven until postmortem neuropathology shows characteristic neurofibrillary and astrocytic tangles. Concern exists that athletes subject to repeated concussive and even subconcussive blows may be at risk of CTE, but no definitive data exist due to the difficulty in diagnosis. Animal models suggest that mild traumatic brain injuries lead to primarily a metabolic derangement with increased excitotoxic neurotransmitter release, extracellular potassium, and intracellular calcium. Further understanding of the underlying pathophysiology may eventually lead to better therapeutic and diagnostic options for the treating clinician. "
2014-09-01,"A new molecular ligand for positron emission tomography (PET) of the human brain, [18F]-T807, is under investigation for the antemortem detection of pathological neurofibrillary aggregates, which are evidence of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) diseases, also known as tauopathies. Repetitive mild traumatic brain injuries in athletes and battlefield veterans are associated with one such tauopathy, known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In a recent case report, a former NFL player with clinically probable CTE and a concurrent Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP) -like syndrome was studied using [18F]-T807. The interpretation of this player's [18F]-T807 PET imaging was complicated by the overlap of tracer uptake in brain regions involved in CTE and PSP with regions associated with either nonspecific [18F]-T807 ligand binding or ""aging-associated"" binding of [18F]-T807 to authentic tauopathy known to be associated with aging and disease severity (i.e., NFT in the mesial temporal lobe). The implications of these data for the utility of [18F]-T807 in the pre-mortem detection of CTE are summarized.  "
2014-09-01,"The long-term consequences of repetitive head impacts have been described since the early 20th century. Terms such as punch drunk and dementia pugilistica were first used to describe the clinical syndromes experienced by boxers. A more generic designation, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), has been employed since the mid-1900s and has been used in recent years to describe a neurodegenerative disease found not just in boxers but in American football players, other contact sport athletes, military veterans, and others with histories of repetitive brain trauma, including concussions and subconcussive trauma. This article reviews the literature of the clinical manifestations of CTE from 202 published cases. The clinical features include impairments in mood (for example, depression and hopelessness), behavior (for example, explosivity and violence), cognition (for example, impaired memory, executive functioning, attention, and dementia), and, less commonly, motor functioning (for example, parkinsonism, ataxia, and dysarthria). We present proposed research criteria for traumatic encephalopathy syndrome (TES) which consist of four variants or subtypes (TES behavioral/mood variant, TES cognitive variant, TES mixed variant, and TES dementia) as well as classifications of 'probable CTE' and 'possible CTE'. These proposed criteria are expected to be modified and updated as new research findings become available. They are not meant to be used for a clinical diagnosis. Rather, they should be viewed as research criteria that can be employed in studies of the underlying causes, risk factors, differential diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of CTE and related disorders.

2014-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a recently revived term used to describe a neurodegenerative process that occurs as a long term complication of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Corsellis provided one of the classic descriptions of CTE in boxers under the name ""dementia pugilistica"" (DP). Much recent attention has been drawn to the apparent association of CTE with contact sports (football, soccer, hockey) and with frequent battlefield exposure to blast waves generated by improvised explosive devices (IEDs). Recently, a promising serum biomarker has been identified by measurement of serum levels of the neuronal microtubule associated protein tau. New positron emission tomography (PET) ligands (e.g., [18 F] T807) that identify brain tauopathy have been successfully deployed for the in vitro and in vivo detection of presumptive tauopathy in the brains of subjects with clinically probable CTE. Major academic and lay publications on DP/CTE were reviewed beginning with the 1928 paper describing the initial use of the term CTE by Martland. The major current concepts in the neurological, psychiatric, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and body fluid biomarker science of DP/CTE have been summarized. Newer achievements, such as serum tau and [18 F] T807 tauopathy imaging, are also introduced and their significance has been explained. Recent advances in the science of DP/CTE hold promise for elucidating a long sought accurate determination of the true prevalence of CTE. This information holds potentially important public health implications for estimating the risk of contact sports in inflicting permanent and/or progressive brain damage on children, adolescents, and adults.

2014-09-01,"Single, severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) which elevates CNS amyloid, increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD); while repetitive concussive and subconcussive events as observed in athletes and military personnel, may increase the risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We describe two clinical cases, one with a history of multiple concussions during a career in the National Football League (NFL) and the second with frontotemporal dementia and a single, severe TBI. Both patients presented with cognitive decline and underwent [(18)F]-Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for amyloid plaques; the retired NFL player also underwent [(18)F]-T807 PET imaging, a new ligand binding to tau, the main constituent of neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Case 1, the former NFL player, was 71 years old when he presented with memory impairment and a clinical profile highly similar to AD. [(18)F]-Florbetapir PET imaging was negative, essentially excluding AD as a diagnosis. CTE was suspected clinically, and [(18)F]-T807 PET imaging revealed striatal and nigral [(18)F]-T807 retention consistent with the presence of tauopathy. Case 2 was a 56-year-old man with personality changes and cognitive decline who had sustained a fall complicated by a subdural hematoma. At 1 year post injury, [(18)F]-Florbetapir PET imaging was negative for an AD pattern of amyloid accumulation in this subject. Focal [(18)F]-Florbetapir retention was noted at the site of impact. In case 1, amyloid imaging provided improved diagnostic accuracy where standard clinical and laboratory criteria were inadequate. In that same case, tau imaging with [(18)F]-T807 revealed a subcortical tauopathy that we interpret as a novel form of CTE with a distribution of tauopathy that mimics, to some extent, that of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), despite a clinical presentation of amnesia without any movement disorder complaints or signs. A key distinguishing feature is that our patient presented with hippocampal involvement, which is more frequently seen in CTE than in PSP. In case 2, focal [(18)F]-Florbetapir retention at the site of injury in an otherwise negative scan suggests focal amyloid aggregation. In each of these complex cases, a combination of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose, [(18)F]-Florbetapir and/or [(18)F]-T807 PET molecular imaging improved the accuracy of diagnosis and prevented inappropriate interventions.

2014-09-01,"The association of military blast exposure and brain injury was first appreciated in World War I as commotio cerebri, and later as shell shock. Similar injuries sustained in modern military conflicts are now classified as mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Recent research has yielded new insights into the mechanisms by which blast exposure leads to acute brain injury and chronic sequelae, including postconcussive syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, post-traumatic headache, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a tau protein neurodegenerative disease. Impediments to delivery of effective medical care for individuals affected by blast-related TBI include: poor insight into the heterogeneity of neurological insults induced by blast exposure; limited understanding of the mechanisms by which blast exposure injures the brain and triggers sequelae; failure to appreciate interactive injuries that affect frontal lobe function, pituitary regulation, and neurovegetative homeostasis; unknown influence of genetic risk factors, prior trauma, and comorbidities; absence of validated diagnostic criteria and clinical nosology that differentiate clinical endophenotypes; and lack of empirical evidence to guide medical management and therapeutic intervention. While clinicopathological analysis can provide evidence of correlative association, experimental use of animal models remains the primary tool for establishing causal mechanisms of disease. However, the TBI field is confronted by a welter of animal models with varying clinical relevance, thereby impeding scientific coherence and hindering translational progress. Animal models of blast TBI will be far more translationally useful if experimental emphasis focuses on accurate reproduction of clinically relevant endpoints (output) rather than scaled replication of idealized blast shockwaves (input). The utility of an animal model is dependent on the degree to which the model recapitulates pathophysiological mechanisms, neuropathological features, and neurological sequelae observed in the corresponding human disorder. Understanding the purpose of an animal model and the criteria by which experimental results derived from the model are validated are critical components for useful animal modeling. Animal models that reliably demonstrate clinically relevant endpoints will expedite development of new treatments, diagnostics, preventive measures, and rehabilitative strategies for individuals affected by blast TBI and its aftermath.

Given the large number of individuals who incur concussions and other forms of brain trauma, this is an important area for scientific and public health inquiry. "
2014-09-01,"Although blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) is well recognized for its significance in the military population, the unique mechanisms of primary bTBI remain undefined. Animate models of primary bTBI are critical for determining these potentially unique mechanisms, but the biomechanical characteristics of many bTBI models are poorly understood. In this study, we examine some common shock tube configurations used to study blast-induced brain injury in the laboratory and define the optimal configuration to minimize the effect of torso overpressure and blast-induced head accelerations. Pressure transducers indicated that a customized animal holder successfully reduced peak torso overpressures to safe levels across all tested configurations. However, high speed video imaging acquired during the blast showed significant head accelerations occurred when animals were oriented perpendicular to the shock tube axis. These findings of complex head motions during blast are similar to previous reports [Goldstein et al., 2012, ""Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy in Blast-Exposed Military Veterans and a Blast Neurotrauma Mouse Model,"" Sci. Transl. Med., 4(134), 134ra160; Sundaramurthy et al., 2012, ""Blast-Induced Biomechanical Loading of the Rat: An Experimental and Anatomically Accurate Computational Blast Injury Model,"" J. Neurotrauma, 29(13), pp. 2352-2364; Svetlov et al., 2010, ""Morphologic and Biochemical Characterization of Brain Injury in a Model of Controlled Blast Overpressure Exposure,"" J. Trauma, 69(4), pp. 795-804]. Under the same blast input conditions, minimizing head acceleration led to a corresponding elimination of righting time deficits. However, we could still achieve righting time deficits under minimal acceleration conditions by significantly increasing the peak blast overpressure. Together, these data show the importance of characterizing the effect of blast overpressure on head kinematics, with the goal of producing models focused on understanding the effects of blast overpressure on the brain without the complicating factor of superimposed head accelerations.

2014-09-01,"Transactivation response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy has recently been reported in chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative condition linked to prior history of traumatic brain injury (TBI). While TDP-43 appears to be vulnerable to proteolytic modifications under neurodegenerative conditions, the mechanism underlying the contribution of TDP-43 to the pathogenesis of TBI remains unknown. In this study, we first mapped out the calpain or caspase-3 TDP-43 fragmentation patterns by in vitro protease digestion. Concurrently, in cultured cerebrocortical neurons subjected to cell death challenges, we identified distinct TDP-43 breakdown products (BDPs) of 35, 33, and 12 kDa that were indicative of dual calpain/caspase attack. Cerebrocortical culture incubated with calpain and caspase-fragmented TDP-43 resulted in neuronal injury. Furthermore, increased TDP-43 BDPs as well as redistributed TDP-43 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm were observed in the mouse cortex in two TBI models: controlled cortical impact injury and overpressure blast-wave-induced brain injury. Finally, TDP-43 and its 35 kDa fragment levels were also elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of severe TBI patients. This is the first evidence that TDP-43 might be involved in acute neuroinjury and TBI pathology, and that TDP-43 and its fragments may have biomarker utilities in TBI patients.  "
2014-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in sports has been known for > 85 years, and has experienced a resurgence of interest over the past decade, both in the media and in the scientific community. However, there appears to be a disconnection between the public's perception of CTE and the currently available scientific data. The cognitive bias known as the ""availability cascade"" has been suggested as a reason to explain this rift in knowledge. This review summarizes and updates the history of CTE in sports, discusses recent epidemiological and autopsy studies, summarizes the evidence base related to CTE in sports, and offers recommendations for future directions.

2014-09-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a rare progressive neurologic disorder that can manifest as a combination of cognitive, mood and behavioral, and neurologic symptoms. Despite clinically apparent symptoms, there is no imaging or other diagnostic test that can confirm diagnosis in living subjects. Diagnosis can only be confirmed postmortem by specific histopathologic features within the brain tissue identified on autopsy. CTE represents a unique tauopathy that is distinct from other neurodegenerative diseases. PubMed was searched from 1990 to 2013 for sport concussion and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Articles were also identified from bibliographies of recent reviews and consensus statements. Clinical review. Level 5. Although CTE is postulated to occur as a result of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury, the specific etiology and risk factors have not yet been elucidated, and postmortem diagnosis makes causality difficult to determine. When counseling athletes and families about the potential association of recurrent concussions and the development of CTE, discussion of proper management of concussion is cornerstone. Unfortunately, to date, there is no equipment that can prevent concussions; however, rule changes and legislation may decrease the risk. It is imperative that return to play is medically supervised by a provider trained in the management of concussion and begins only once symptoms have resolved. In addition, athletes with permanent symptoms should be retired from contact sport. "
2014-09-01,"Neuropathology and surveys of retired National Football League (NFL) players suggest that chronic brain damage is a frequent result of a career in football. There is limited information on the neurological statuses of living retired players. This study aimed to fill the gap in knowledge by conducting in-depth neurological examinations of 30- to 60-year-old retired NFL players. In-depth neurological examinations of 30- to 60-year-old retired players are unlikely to detect objective clinical abnormalities in the majority of subjects. A day-long medical examination was conducted on 45 retired NFL players, including state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; susceptibility weighted imaging [SWI], diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]), comprehensive neuropsychological and neurological examinations, interviews, blood tests, and APOE (apolipoprotein E) genotyping. Level 3. Participants' histories focused on neurological and depression symptoms, exposure to football, and other factors that could affect brain function. The neurological examination included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) evaluation of cognitive function and a comprehensive search for signs of dysarthria, pyramidal system dysfunction, extrapyramidal system dysfunction, and cerebellar dysfunction. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) measured depression. Neuropsychological tests included pen-and-paper and ImPACT evaluation of cognitive function. Anatomical examination SWI and DTI MRI searched for brain injuries. The results were statistically analyzed for associations with markers of exposure to football and related factors, such as body mass index (BMI), ethanol use, and APOE4 status. The retired players' ages averaged 45.6 ± 8.9 years (range, 30-60 years), and they had 6.8 ± 3.2 years (maximum, 14 years) of NFL play. They reported 6.9 ± 6.2 concussions (maximum, 25) in the NFL. The majority of retired players had normal clinical mental status and central nervous system (CNS) neurological examinations. Four players (9%) had microbleeds in brain parenchyma identified in SWI, and 3 (7%) had a large cavum septum pellucidum with brain atrophy. The number of concussions/dings was associated with abnormal results in SWI and DTI. Neuropsychological testing revealed isolated impairments in 11 players (24%), but none had dementia. Nine players (20%) endorsed symptoms of moderate or severe depression on the BDI and/or met criteria for depression on PHQ; however, none had dementia, dysarthria, parkinsonism, or cerebellar dysfunction. The number of football-related concussions was associated with isolated abnormalities on the clinical neurological examination, suggesting CNS dysfunction. The APOE4 allele was present in 38% of the players, a larger number than would be expected in the general male population (23%-26%). MRI lesions and neuropsychological impairments were found in some players; however, the majority of retired NFL players had no clinical signs of chronic brain damage. These results need to be reconciled with the prevailing view that a career in football frequently results in chronic brain damage. "
2014-08-01,"We present a coarse-grained two dimensional mechanical model for the microtubule-tau bundles in neuronal axons in which we remove taus, as can happen in various neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimers disease, tauopathies, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Our simplified model includes (i) taus modeled as entropic springs between microtubules, (ii) removal of taus from the bundles due to phosphorylation, and (iii) a possible depletion force between microtubules due to these dissociated phosphorylated taus. We equilibrate upon tau removal using steepest descent relaxation. In the absence of the depletion force, the transverse rigidity to radial compression of the bundles falls to zero at about 60% tau occupancy, in agreement with standard percolation theory results. However, with the attractive depletion force, spring removal leads to a first order collapse of the bundles over a wide range of tau occupancies for physiologically realizable conditions. While our simplest calculations assume a constant concentration of microtubule intercalants to mediate the depletion force, including a dependence that is linear in the detached taus yields the same collapse. Applying percolation theory to removal of taus at microtubule tips, which are likely to be the protective sites against dynamic instability, we argue that the microtubule instability can only obtain at low tau occupancy, from 0.06-0.30 depending upon the tau coordination at the microtubule tips. Hence, the collapse we discover is likely to be more robust over a wide range of tau occupancies than the dynamic instability. We suggest in vitro tests of our predicted collapse.  "
2014-08-01,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) resulting from exposure to blast shock waves (BSWs) is one of the most predominant causes of illnesses among veterans who served in the recent Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Such mTBI can also happen to civilians if exposed to shock waves of bomb attacks by terrorists. While cognitive problems, memory dysfunction, depression, anxiety and diffuse white matter injury have been observed at both early and/or delayed time-points, an initial brain pathology resulting from exposure to BSWs appears to be the dysfunction or disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Studies in animal models suggest that exposure to relatively milder BSWs (123 kPa) initially induces free radical generating enzymes in and around brain capillaries, which enhances oxidative stress resulting in loss of tight junction (TJ) proteins, edema formation, and leakiness of BBB with disruption or loss of its components pericytes and astrocyte end-feet. On the other hand, exposure to more intense BSWs (145-323 kPa) causes acute disruption of the BBB with vascular lesions in the brain. Both of these scenarios lead to apoptosis of endothelial and neural cells and neuroinflammation in and around capillaries, which may progress into chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and/or a variety of neurological impairments, depending on brain regions that are afflicted with such lesions. This review discusses studies that examined alterations in the brain milieu causing dysfunction or disruption of the BBB and neuroinflammation following exposure to different intensities of BSWs. Furthermore, potential of early intervention strategies capable of easing oxidative stress, repairing the BBB or blocking inflammation for minimizing delayed neurological deficits resulting from exposure to BSWs is conferred.

2014-08-01,"Every country around the world enjoys some sort of sport. The Olympics sees countries from all over the globe participate in elite sport, in both winter and summer competitions. Australia is widely known for cricket and rugby; America is known for baseball and gridiron football (among others). These sports are played at an elite level as well as beginners from early ages as young as 4 years in the backyard. Yet, it is also these sports that can deliver a ball at the speed of 100 km/h (football), 105 km/h (baseball), 112 km/h (rugby), 150 km/h (cricket), and 211 km/h (soccer). This is the same force that a car collision can produce. That force eventually finds a target, and in some cases, unfortunately, it is a head. Damage to the brain is not only from the impact of the ball hitting its target but rather also the shearing forces of acceleration-deceleration injury that can cause extensive injuries. There has been much discussion of late regarding concussion in sport and the accumulative effects of head blows resulting in varying degrees of memory loss and dementia later in life. The media have been saturated with heightened awareness of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. This, however, is still being researched. It is true that each concussion compounds the one before, but rather than focus on the injury, managers/coaches and sporting codes should be focusing on the identification and proper management of a suspected concussion and the return-to-play protocols. This is especially important in our schools where growing brains need nurturing. Neuroscience nurses are at the forefront of educating school children, teachers, and coaches through partnering with local schools. This article will focus on concussion recognition and management in school sport.  "
2017-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy resulting from head hits and concussions is an unfortunate illness that has affected numerous football players, especially in the National Football League.

2014-07-01,"There has been an increased focus on the neurological sequelae of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly neurodegenerative syndromes, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE); however, no animal model exists that captures the behavioral spectrum of this phenomenon. We sought to develop an animal model of CTE. Our novel model is a modification and fusion of two of the most popular models of TBI and allows for controlled closed-head impacts to unanesthetized mice. Two-hundred and eighty 12-week-old mice were divided into control, single mild TBI (mTBI), and repetitive mTBI groups. Repetitive mTBI mice received six concussive impacts daily for 7 days. Behavior was assessed at various time points. Neurological Severity Score (NSS) was computed and vestibulomotor function tested with the wire grip test (WGT). Cognitive function was assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM), anxiety/risk-taking behavior with the elevated plus maze, and depression-like behavior with the forced swim/tail suspension tests. Sleep electroencephalogram/electromyography studies were performed at 1 month. NSS was elevated, compared to controls, in both TBI groups and improved over time. Repetitive mTBI mice demonstrated transient vestibulomotor deficits on WGT. Repetitive mTBI mice also demonstrated deficits in MWM testing. Both mTBI groups demonstrated increased anxiety at 2 weeks, but repetitive mTBI mice developed increased risk-taking behaviors at 1 month that persist at 6 months. Repetitive mTBI mice exhibit depression-like behavior at 1 month. Both groups demonstrate sleep disturbances. We describe the neurological sequelae of repetitive mTBI in a novel mouse model, which resemble several of the neuropsychiatric behaviors observed clinically in patients sustaining repetitive mild head injury.

2014-07-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Cerebral microbleeds, focal inflammation, and white matter damage are associated with many neurological and neurodegenerative disorders including CTE, AD, PD, vascular dementia, stroke, and TBI. This study evaluates microvascular abnormalities observed at acute and chronic stages following TBI in rats, and examines pathological processes associated with these abnormalities. TBI in adult rats was induced by controlled cortical impact (CCI) of two magnitudes. Brain pathology was assessed in white matter of the corpus callosum for 24 h to 3 months following injury using immunohistochemistry (IHC). TBI resulted in focal microbleeds that were related to the magnitude of injury. At the lower magnitude of injury, microbleeds gradually increased over the 3 month duration of the study. IHC revealed TBI-induced focal abnormalities including blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage (IgG), endothelial damage (intercellular adhesion molecule 1 [ICAM-1]), activation of reactive microglia (ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 [Iba1]), gliosis (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and macrophage-mediated inflammation (cluster of differentiation 68 [CD68]), all showing different temporal profiles. At chronic stages (up to 3 months), apparent myelin loss (Luxol fast blue) and scattered deposition of microbleeds were observed. Microbleeds were surrounded by glial scars and co-localized with CD68 and IgG puncta stainings, suggesting that localized BBB breakdown and inflammation were associated with vascular damage. Our results indicate that evolving white matter degeneration following experimental TBI is associated with significantly delayed microvascular damage and focal microbleeds that are temporally and regionally associated with development of punctate BBB breakdown and progressive inflammatory responses. Increased understanding of mechanisms underlying delayed microvascular damage following TBI could provide novel insights into chronic pathological responses to TBI and potential common mechanisms underlying TBI and neurodegenerative diseases.

2014-07-01,"Significant attention has recently been drawn to the potential link between head trauma and the development of neurodegenerative disease, namely chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The acute neurotrauma associated with sports-related concussions in athletes and blast-induced traumatic brain injury in soldiers elevates the risk for future development of chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE. CTE is a progressive disease distinguished by characteristic tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and, occasionally, transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP43) oligomers, both of which have a predilection for perivascular and subcortical areas near reactive astrocytes and microglia. The disease is currently only diagnosed postmortem by neuropathological identification of NFTs. A recent workshop sponsored by National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke emphasized the need for premortem diagnosis, to better understand disease pathophysiology and to develop targeted treatments. In order to accomplish this objective, it is necessary to discover the mechanistic link between acute neurotrauma and the development of chronic neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders such as CTE. In this review, we briefly summarize what is currently known about CTE development and pathophysiology, and subsequently discuss injury-induced pathways that warrant further investigation. Understanding the mechanistic link between acute brain injury and chronic neurodegeneration will facilitate the development of appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic options for CTE and other related disorders.

2014-06-01,"The number of sports-related concussions has been steadily rising in recent years. Diminished brain resilience syndrome is a term coined by the lead author to describe a particular physiological state of nutrient functional deficiency and disrupted homeostatic mechanisms leading to increased susceptibility to previously considered innocuous concussion. We discuss how modern day environmental toxicant exposure, along with major changes in our food supply and lifestyle practices, profoundly reduce the bioavailability of neuro-critical nutrients such that the normal processes of homeostatic balance and resilience are no longer functional. Their diminished capacity triggers physiological and biochemical 'work around' processes that result in undesirable downstream consequences. Exposure to certain environmental chemicals, particularly glyphosate, the active ingredient in the herbicide, Roundup(®), may disrupt the body's innate switching mechanism, which normally turns off the immune response to brain injury once danger has been removed. Deficiencies in serotonin, due to disruption of the shikimate pathway, may lead to impaired melatonin supply, which reduces the resiliency of the brain through reduced antioxidant capacity and alterations in the cerebrospinal fluid, reducing critical protective buffering mechanisms in impact trauma. Depletion of certain rare minerals, overuse of sunscreen and/or overprotection from sun exposure, as well as overindulgence in heavily processed, nutrient deficient foods, further compromise the brain's resilience. Modifications to lifestyle practices, if widely implemented, could significantly reduce this trend of neurological damage.  "
2014-06-01,"The military conflicts of the last decade have highlighted the growing problem of traumatic brain injury in combatants returning from the battlefield. The considerable evidence pointing at the accumulation of tau aggregates and its recognition as a risk factor in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease have led to a major effort to develop selective tau ligands that would allow research into the physiopathologic underpinnings of traumatic brain injury and chronic traumatic encephalopathy in military personnel and the civilian population. These tracers will allow new insights into tau pathology in the human brain, facilitating research into causes, diagnosis, and treatment of traumatic encephalopathy and major neurodegenerative dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease and some variants of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, in which tau plays a role. The field of selective tau imaging has to overcome several obstacles, some of them associated with the idiosyncrasies of tau aggregation and others related to radiotracer design. A worldwide effort has focused on the development of imaging agents that will allow selective tau imaging in vivo. Recent progress in the development of these tracers is enabling the noninvasive assessment of the extent of tau pathology in the brain, eventually allowing the quantification of changes in tau pathology over time and its relation to cognitive performance, brain volumetrics, and other biomarkers, as well as assessment of efficacy and patient recruitment for antitau therapeutic trials.

2014-06-01,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) includes concussion, subconcussion, and most exposures to explosive blast from improvised explosive devices. mTBI is the most common traumatic brain injury affecting military personnel; however, it is the most difficult to diagnose and the least well understood. It is also recognized that some mTBIs have persistent, and sometimes progressive, long-term debilitating effects. Increasing evidence suggests that a single traumatic brain injury can produce long-term gray and white matter atrophy, precipitate or accelerate age-related neurodegeneration, and increase the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and motor neuron disease. In addition, repetitive mTBIs can provoke the development of a tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy. We found early changes of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in four young veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflict who were exposed to explosive blast and in another young veteran who was repetitively concussed. Four of the five veterans with early-stage chronic traumatic encephalopathy were also diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder. Advanced chronic traumatic encephalopathy has been found in veterans who experienced repetitive neurotrauma while in service and in others who were accomplished athletes. Clinically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy is associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, memory loss, and cognitive impairments that begin insidiously and progress slowly over decades. Pathologically, chronic traumatic encephalopathy produces atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes, thalamus, and hypothalamus; septal abnormalities; and abnormal deposits of hyperphosphorylated tau as neurofibrillary tangles and disordered neurites throughout the brain. The incidence and prevalence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy and the genetic risk factors critical to its development are currently unknown. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy has clinical and pathological features that overlap with postconcussion syndrome and posttraumatic stress disorder, suggesting that the three disorders might share some biological underpinnings.  "
2014-06-01,"Population-based studies have supported the hypothesis that a positive history of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with an increased incidence of neurological disease and psychiatric comorbidities, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. These epidemiologic studies, however, do not offer a clear definition of that risk, and leave unanswered the bounding criteria for greater lifetime risk of neurodegeneration. Key factors that likely mediate the degree of risk of neurodegeneration include genetic factors, significant premorbid and comorbid medical history (e.g. depression, multiple head injuries and repetitive subconcussive impact to the brain, occupational risk, age at injury, and severity of brain injury). However, given the often-described concerns in self-report accuracy as it relates to history of multiple TBIs, low frequency of patient presentation to a physician in the case of mild brain injuries, and challenges with creating clear distinctions between injury severities, disentangling the true risk for neurodegeneration based solely on population-based studies will likely remain elusive. Given this reality, multiple modalities and approaches must be combined to characterize who are at risk so that appropriate interventions to alter progression of neurodegeneration can be evaluated. This article presents data from a study that highlights uses of neuroimaging and areas of needed research in the link between TBI and neurodegenerative disease.  "
2014-06-01,"Sports-related head impact and injury has become a very highly contentious public health and medico-legal issue. Near-daily news accounts describe the travails of concussed athletes as they struggle with depression, sleep disorders, mood swings, and cognitive problems. Some of these individuals have developed chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive and debilitating neurodegenerative disorder. Animal models have always been an integral part of the study of traumatic brain injury in humans but, historically, they have concentrated on acute, severe brain injuries. This review will describe a small number of new and emerging animal models of sports-related head injury that have the potential to increase our understanding of how multiple mild head impacts, starting in adolescence, can have serious psychiatric, cognitive and histopathological outcomes much later in life. Sports-related head injury (SRHI) has emerged as a significant public health issue as athletes can develop psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders later in life. Animal models have always been an integral part of the study of human TBI but few existing methods are valid for studying SRHI. In this review, we propose criteria for effective animal models of SRHI. Movement of the head upon impact is judged to be of primary importance in leading to concussion and persistent CNS dysfunction.  "
2014-05-01,"The identification of tau protein as a major constituent of neurofibrillary tangles spurred considerable effort devoted to identifying and validating pathways through which therapeutics may alleviate tau burden in Alzheimer's disease and related tauopathies, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy associated with sport- and military-related injuries. Most tau-based therapeutic strategies have previously focused on modulating tau phosphorylation, given that tau species present within neurofibrillary tangles are hyperphosphorylated on a number of different residues. However, the recent discovery that tau is modified by acetylation necessitates additional research to provide greater mechanistic insight into the spectrum of physiological consequences of tau acetylation, which may hold promise as a novel therapeutic target. In this review, we discuss recent findings evaluating tau acetylation in the context of previously accepted notions regarding tau biology and pathophysiology. We also examine the evidence demonstrating the neuroprotective and beneficial consequences of inhibiting histone deacetylase (HDAC)6, a tau deacetylase, including its effect on microtubule stabilization. We also discuss the rationale for pharmacologically modulating HDAC6 in tau-based pathologies as a novel therapeutic strategy.  "
2014-05-01,"Contact sports have long been a part of human existence. The two earliest recorded organized contact games, both of which still exist, include Royal Shrovetide Football played since the 12(th) century in England and Caid played since 1308 AD in Ireland. Rugby is the premier contact sport played throughout the world with the very popular derivative American football being the premier contact sport of the North American continent. American football in the USA has on average 1,205,037 players at the high school and collegiate level per year while rugby in the USA boasts a playing enrollment of 457,983 at all levels. Recent media have highlighted injury in the context of competitive contact sports including their long-term sequelae such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that had previously been underappreciated. Blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI) has become a recognized injury pattern for trauma; however, a paucity of data regarding this injury can be found in the sports trauma literature. We present a case of an international level scrum-half playing Rugby Union at club level for a local non-professional team, in which a player sustained a fatal BCVI followed by a discussion of the literature surrounding sport related BCVI.

2014-05-01,"We analyzed data from 74 male collegiate hockey players. Each athlete's season began with a baseline administration of the Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing (ImPACT) neuropsychology test battery. Fourteen athletes sustained a sport-related head injury and were readministered the test to assess the impact of the injury. A significant decrease in performance (compared to baseline) on immediate and delayed word recall and designs followed the first concussion. Following a second sport-related concussion, the 4 affected athletes showed significant decrease in visual motor speed. Performance improved on 2 response speed measures (Ps < .01). More errors occurred during a visual processing/discrimination task and immediate recall of designs declined (Ps < .05). We discuss the results in light of recent work related to the impact of early-life concussions and head injury on late-life consequences, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and more immediate issues such as return-to-play decisions for athletes.

2014-05-01,"The cell danger response (CDR) is the evolutionarily conserved metabolic response that protects cells and hosts from harm. It is triggered by encounters with chemical, physical, or biological threats that exceed the cellular capacity for homeostasis. The resulting metabolic mismatch between available resources and functional capacity produces a cascade of changes in cellular electron flow, oxygen consumption, redox, membrane fluidity, lipid dynamics, bioenergetics, carbon and sulfur resource allocation, protein folding and aggregation, vitamin availability, metal homeostasis, indole, pterin, 1-carbon and polyamine metabolism, and polymer formation. The first wave of danger signals consists of the release of metabolic intermediates like ATP and ADP, Krebs cycle intermediates, oxygen, and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and is sustained by purinergic signaling. After the danger has been eliminated or neutralized, a choreographed sequence of anti-inflammatory and regenerative pathways is activated to reverse the CDR and to heal. When the CDR persists abnormally, whole body metabolism and the gut microbiome are disturbed, the collective performance of multiple organ systems is impaired, behavior is changed, and chronic disease results. Metabolic memory of past stress encounters is stored in the form of altered mitochondrial and cellular macromolecule content, resulting in an increase in functional reserve capacity through a process known as mitocellular hormesis. The systemic form of the CDR, and its magnified form, the purinergic life-threat response (PLTR), are under direct control by ancient pathways in the brain that are ultimately coordinated by centers in the brainstem. Chemosensory integration of whole body metabolism occurs in the brainstem and is a prerequisite for normal brain, motor, vestibular, sensory, social, and speech development. An understanding of the CDR permits us to reframe old concepts of pathogenesis for a broad array of chronic, developmental, autoimmune, and degenerative disorders. These disorders include autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), asthma, atopy, gluten and many other food and chemical sensitivity syndromes, emphysema, Tourette's syndrome, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), traumatic brain injury (TBI), epilepsy, suicidal ideation, organ transplant biology, diabetes, kidney, liver, and heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer and Parkinson disease, and autoimmune disorders like lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and primary sclerosing cholangitis.

2014-04-01,"Repetitive head impacts (RHI) sustained in contact sports are thought to be necessary for the long-term development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Our objectives were to: 1) characterize the magnitude and persistence of RHI-induced white matter (WM) changes; 2) determine their relationship to kinematic measures of RHI; and 3) explore their clinical relevance. Prospective, observational study of 10 Division III college football players and 5 non-athlete controls during the 2011-12 season. All subjects underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), physiologic, cognitive, and balance testing at pre-season (Time 1), post-season (Time 2), and after 6-months of no-contact rest (Time 3). Head impact measures were recorded using helmet-mounted accelerometers. The percentage of whole-brain WM voxels with significant changes in fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) from Time 1 to 2, and Time 1 to 3 was determined for each subject and correlated to head impacts and clinical measures. Total head impacts for the season ranged from 431-1,850. No athlete suffered a clinically evident concussion. Compared to controls, athletes experienced greater changes in FA and MD from Time 1 to 2 as well as Time 1 to 3; most differences at Time 2 persisted to Time 3. Among athletes, the percentage of voxels with decreased FA from Time 1 to 2 was positively correlated with several helmet impact measures. The persistence of WM changes from Time 1 to 3 was also associated with changes in serum ApoA1 and S100B autoantibodies. WM changes were not consistently associated with cognition or balance. A single football season of RHIs without clinically-evident concussion resulted in WM changes that correlated with multiple helmet impact measures and persisted following 6 months of no-contact rest. This lack of WM recovery could potentially contribute to cumulative WM changes with subsequent RHI exposures. "

2014-04-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) formerly known as dementia pugilistica is a long-term neurodegenerative disorder associated with repeated subconcussive head injuries in high-contact sports. We reviewed the existing literature on CTE and examined epidemiological trends, risk factors, and its temporal progression, and proposed the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms that may provide unique insights to clinicians with an in-depth understanding of the disease to aid in the diagnosis and prevention, and provide future perspectives for research via search of Medline and Cochrane databases as well as manual review of bibliographies from selected articles and monographs. The prevalence of CTE in recent years is on the rise and almost exclusively affects men, with pathologic signs characterized by progressive memory loss, behavioral changes, and violent tendencies with some patients demonstrating Parkinsonian-like symptoms and signs. Many patients with CTE die following suicide, accident, or complications of drug or alcohol use. Postmortem pathologic analysis is characterized by neurofibrillary tangles and Aβ plaques in 50 % of cases. Currently, there are no ante-mortem diagnostic criteria, but modern imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, MR spectroscopy, and diffusion tension imaging hold promise for delineating the future diagnostic criteria. Further long-term longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate risk factors that will enhance understanding of the disease progression and its pathogenesis. "

Several studies have investigated head impacts in football at the professional, collegiate, and high school levels, in an attempt to elucidate the biomechanics of head impacts among football players. Youth football players, generally from 7 to 14 years of age, constitute 70% of all football players, yet burden of, and susceptibility to, head injury in this population is not well known. A novel impact sensor utilizing binary force switches (Shockbox(®)) was used to follow an entire Pop Warner football team consisting of twenty-two players for six games and five practices. The impact sensor was designed to record impacts with linear accelerations over 30g. In addition, video recording of games and practices were used to further characterize the head impacts by type of position (skilled versus unskilled), field location of impact (open field versus line of scrimmage), type of hit (tackling, tackled, or hold/push), and whether the impact was a head-to-head impact or not. We recorded a total of 480 head impacts. An average of 21.8 head impacts occurred per practice, while 61.8 occurred per game. Players had an average of 3.7 head impacts per game and 1.5 impacts per practice (p<0.001). The number of high magnitude head impacts (>80g) was 11. Two concussions were diagnosed over the course of the season. However, due to technical reasons the biomechanics of those hits resulting in concussions were not captured. Despite smaller players and slower play when compared to high school, collegiate or professional players, those involved in youth football sustain a moderate number of head impacts per season with several high magnitude impacts. Our results suggest that players involved in open-field, tackling plays that have head-to-head contact sustain impacts with the highest linear accelerations. Our data supports previously published data that suggests changes to the rules of play during practice can reduce the burden of hits. "
2014-03-01,"Diffuse axonal injury after traumatic brain injury (TBI) produces neurological impairment by disconnecting brain networks. This structural damage can be mapped using diffusion MRI, and its functional effects can be investigated in large-scale intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs). Here, we review evidence that TBI substantially disrupts ICN function, and that this disruption predicts cognitive impairment. We focus on two ICNs--the salience network and the default mode network. The activity of these ICNs is normally tightly coupled, which is important for attentional control. Damage to the structural connectivity of these networks produces predictable abnormalities of network function and cognitive control. For example, the brain normally shows a 'small-world architecture' that is optimized for information processing, but TBI shifts network function away from this organization. The effects of TBI on network function are likely to be complex, and we discuss how advanced approaches to modelling brain dynamics can provide insights into the network dysfunction. We highlight how structural network damage caused by axonal injury might interact with neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which are late complications of TBI. Finally, we discuss how network-level diagnostics could inform diagnosis, prognosis and treatment development following TBI. "
2014-02-01,"Sports-related concussions are one of the major causes of mild traumatic brain injury. Although most patients recover completely within days to weeks, those who experience repetitive brain trauma (RBT) may be at risk for developing a condition known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). While this condition is most commonly observed in athletes who experience repetitive concussive and/or subconcussive blows to the head, such as boxers, football players, or hockey players, CTE may also affect soldiers on active duty. Currently, the only means by which to diagnose CTE is by the presence of phosphorylated tau aggregations post-mortem. Non-invasive neuroimaging, however, may allow early diagnosis as well as improve our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of RBT. The purpose of this article is to review advanced neuroimaging methods used to investigate RBT, including diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, functional magnetic resonance imaging, susceptibility weighted imaging, and positron emission tomography. While there is a considerable literature using these methods in brain injury in general, the focus of this review is on RBT and those subject populations currently known to be susceptible to RBT, namely athletes and soldiers. Further, while direct detection of CTE in vivo has not yet been achieved, all of the methods described in this review provide insight into RBT and will likely lead to a better characterization (diagnosis), in vivo, of CTE than measures of self-report.

2014-02-01,"We report the case of a 75-year-old ex-professional boxer who developed diplopia and eye movement abnormalities in his 60's followed by memory impairment, low mood and recurrent falls. Examination shortly before death revealed hypomimia, dysarthria, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and impaired postural reflexes. Pathological examination demonstrated 4-repeat tau neuronal and glial lesions, including tufted astrocytes, consistent with a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy. In addition, neurofibrillary tangles composed of mixed 3-repeat and 4-repeat tau and astrocytic tangles in a distribution highly suggestive of chronic traumatic encephalopathy were observed together with limbic TDP-43 pathology. Possible mechanisms for the co-occurrence of these two tau pathologies are discussed.  "
2014-02-01,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), although often presenting without the gross structural abnormalities seen in more severe forms of brain trauma, can nonetheless result in lingering cognitive and behavioral problems along with subtle alterations in brain structure and function. Repeated injuries are associated with brain atrophy and dementia in the form of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The mechanisms underlying these dysfunctions are poorly understood. There is a growing body of evidence that brain iron is abnormal after TBI, and brain iron has also been implicated in a host of neurodegenerative disorders. The purpose of this article is to review evidence about the function of iron in the pathophysiology of mTBI and the role that advanced imaging modalities can play in further elucidating said function. MRI techniques sensitive to field inhomogeneities provide supporting evidence for both deep gray matter non-heme iron accumulation as well as focal microhemorrhage resulting from mTBI. In addition, there is evidence that iron may contribute to pathology after mTBI through a number of mechanisms, including generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), exacerbation of oxidative stress from other sources, and encouragement of tau phosphorylation and the formation of neurofibrillary tangles. Finally, recent animal studies suggest that iron may serve as a therapeutic target in mitigating the effects of mTBI. However, research on the presence and role of iron in mTBI and CTE is still relatively sparse, and further work is necessary to elucidate issues such as the sources of increased iron and the chain of secondary injury.

2014-02-01,"Education has a protective effect against cognitive deficits following various forms of brain insult. Professional fighting (boxing and mixed martial arts) provides a model for assessing the impact of cumulative brain injuries on cognition and brain health. In the current cross-sectional observational study, we explore whether education would be protective against cognitive loss in fighters. We tested 141 professional fighters using a computerized neurocognitive battery, in addition to structural MRI. We used automated segmentation software to compute the volumes of various brain structures. We found fighters with high school education or less to show more associations between fight exposure and cognitive test scores. The relationship between brain structure volume and exposure did not differ based on education. These results are interpreted as putatively showing a protective effect of education on functional integrity in fighters, although longitudinal data and a larger sample size are required to further understand this relationship.

2014-02-01,"Millions of concussions occur every year in the United States. The public interest in concussion has increased after a number of high-profile deaths in high school athletes from sports-related head trauma and in some professional athletes from chronic traumatic encephalopathy. One of the most active areas of research in sports medicine during the last decade has been the evaluation and management of concussion. In this second article of a two-part series, we provide an overview of the latest scientific advances in concussion research. This overview includes an update on the pathobiological changes that occur during concussion and the results of biomechanical studies. In addition, to aid the practicing clinician, we review the literature on proven and currently studied concussion risk factors, including a history of concussion, fatigue, and age. Genetic polymorphisms and biomarkers may provide risk-prediction capability, but at present the research remains inconclusive. Diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic resonance imaging are promising technologies that reveal more sophisticated data about the impact of concussion on the brain. We review the existing literature on the application of these neuroimaging modalities to sports concussion. An update from the Fourth International Conference on Concussion in Sport, with highlights of new recommendations, and the presentation of the third edition of the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool to evaluate acute concussion, concludes our review. "
2014-01-01,"""Chronic traumatic encephalopathy"" (CTE) is described as a slowly progressive neurodegenerative disease believed to result from multiple concussions. Traditionally, concussions were considered benign events and although most people recover fully, about 10% develop a post-concussive syndrome with persisting neurological, cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms. CTE was once thought to be unique to boxers, but it has now been observed in many different athletes having suffered multiple concussions as well as in military personal after repeated blast injuries. Much remains unknown about the development of CTE but its pathological substrate is usually tau, similar to that seen in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). The aim of this ""perspective"" is to compare and contrast clinical and pathological CTE with the other neurodegenerative proteinopathies and highlight that there is an urgent need for understanding the relationship between concussion and the development of CTE as it may provide a window into the development of a proteinopathy and thus new avenues for treatment.  "
2014-01-01,"Traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are induced by sudden acceleration-deceleration and/or rotational forces acting on the brain. Diffuse axonal injury (DAI) has been identified as one of the chief underlying causes of morbidity and mortality in head trauma incidents. DAIs refer to microscopic white matter (WM) injuries as a result of shearing forces that induce pathological and anatomical changes within the brain, which potentially contribute to significant impairments later in life. These microscopic injuries are often unidentifiable by the conventional computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) scans employed by emergency departments to initially assess head trauma patients and, as a result, TBIs are incredibly difficult to diagnose. The impairments associated with TBI may be caused by secondary mechanisms that are initiated at the moment of injury, but often have delayed clinical presentations that are difficult to assess due to the initial misdiagnosis. As a result, the true consequences of these head injuries may go unnoticed at the time of injury and for many years thereafter. The purpose of this review is to investigate these consequences of TBI and their potential link to neurodegenerative disease (ND). This review will summarize the current epidemiological findings, the pathological similarities, and new neuroimaging techniques that may help delineate the relationship between TBI and ND. Lastly, this review will discuss future directions and propose new methods to overcome the limitations that are currently impeding research progress. It is imperative that improved techniques are developed to adequately and retrospectively assess TBI history in patients that may have been previously undiagnosed in order to increase the validity and reliability across future epidemiological studies. The authors introduce a new surveillance tool (Retrospective Screening of Traumatic Brain Injury Questionnaire, RESTBI) to address this concern. "
2014-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs in association with repetitive traumatic brain injury experienced in sport and military service. In most instances, the clinical symptoms of the disease begin after a long period of latency ranging from several years to several decades. The initial symptoms are typically insidious, consisting of irritability, impulsivity, aggression, depression, short-term memory loss and heightened suicidality. The symptoms progress slowly over decades to include cognitive deficits and dementia. The pathology of CTE is characterized by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein in neurons and astrocytes in a pattern that is unique from other tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease. The hyperphosphorylated tau abnormalities begin focally, as perivascular neurofibrillary tangles and neurites at the depths of the cerebral sulci, and then spread to involve superficial layers of adjacent cortex before becoming a widespread degeneration affecting medial temporal lobe structures, diencephalon and brainstem. Most instances of CTE (>85% of cases) show abnormal accumulations of phosphorylated 43 kDa TAR DNA binding protein that are partially colocalized with phosphorylated tau protein. As CTE is characterized pathologically by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy, by abnormal deposits of phosphorylated tau and by 43 kDa TAR DNA binding protein and is associated clinically with behavioral and personality changes, as well as cognitive impairments, CTE is increasingly categorized as an acquired frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Currently, some of the greatest challenges are that CTE cannot be diagnosed during life and the incidence and prevalence of the disorder remain uncertain. Furthermore, the contribution of age, gender, genetics, stress, alcohol and substance abuse to the development of CTE remains to be determined.  "
2014-01-01,"The benefits of regular exercise, physical fitness and sports participation on cardiovascular and brain health are undeniable. Physical activity reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and stroke, and produces beneficial effects on cholesterol levels, antioxidant systems, inflammation, and vascular function. Exercise also enhances psychological health, reduces age-related loss of brain volume, improves cognition, reduces the risk of developing dementia, and impedes neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, the play of sports is associated with risks, including a risk for mild TBI (mTBI) and, rarely, catastrophic traumatic injury and death. There is also growing awareness that repetitive mTBIs, such as concussion and subconcussion, can occasionally produce persistent cognitive, behavioral, and psychiatric problems as well as lead to the development of a neurodegeneration, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In this review, we summarize the beneficial aspects of sports participation on psychological, emotional, physical and cognitive health, and specifically analyze some of the less common adverse neuropathological outcomes, including concussion, second-impact syndrome, juvenile head trauma syndrome, catastrophic sudden death, and CTE. CTE is a latent neurodegeneration clinically associated with behavioral changes, executive dysfunction and cognitive impairments, and pathologically characterized by frontal and temporal lobe atrophy, neuronal and axonal loss, and abnormal deposits of paired helical filament (PHF)-tau and 43 kDa TAR deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-binding protein (TDP-43). CTE often occurs as a sole diagnosis, but may be associated with other neurodegenerative disorders, including motor neuron disease (CTE-MND). Although the incidence and prevalence of CTE are not known, CTE has been reported most frequently in American football players and boxers. Other sports associated with CTE include ice hockey, professional wrestling, soccer, rugby, and baseball. "
2014-01-01,"It is now recognised that there is a spectrum of concussion disorders ranging from acute concussion at one end to various forms of brain degeneration at the other end. The spectrum includes acute concussion, second impact syndrome or acute cerebral swelling, postconcussion syndrome, depression or anxiety, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and possibly other forms of central nervous system degeneration. It is essential to carefully evaluate the clinical and neuropathological correlations of CTE that have been published. This has been accomplished in an excellent paper on this subject by Gardner and colleagues in this issue. There have been significant advances in our knowledge of the clinical and neuropathological features of CTE in athletes in the past 10 years. However, we are just at the beginning of our appreciation of this entity due to the paucity of research and the inability to diagnose CTE during life. At present, it is not possible to assess the validity of the proposed methods of classification and grading of the severity of the disease. Additional studies of large numbers of at-risk athletes are essential, especially prospective longitudinal studies. Obviously, such studies would be even more effective if reliable in vivo biomarkers were discovered, especially non-invasive ones such as advanced MRI or MR spectroscopy or invasive ones such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid tests. The major questions that remain unanswered include the frequency of CTE in various collision sports, the causal or otherwise relationship between concussions and CTE, the number of concussions that need to be involved and their management.  "
2014-01-01,"In the initial autopsy case studies of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), some researchers have concluded that the proteinopathy associated with CTE is the underlying cause of suicidality and completed suicide in former athletes. A review of the literature on contact sports and risk of completed suicide revealed only one epidemiological study with direct relevant data. There are no published cross-sectional, epidemiological or prospective studies showing a relation between contact sports and risk of suicide. One published epidemiological study suggests that retired National Football League players have lower rates of death by suicide than the general population. Outside of sports, there is a mature body of evidence suggesting that the causes of suicide are complex, multifactorial and difficult to predict in individual cases. Future research might establish a clear causal connection between the proteinopathy of CTE and suicide. At present, however, there is insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that there is a strong causal relationship between the presence of these proteinopathies and suicide in former athletes. Additional research is needed to determine the extent to which the neuropathology of CTE is a possible mediator or moderator variable associated with suicide. "

2014-01-01,"To provide a critical review of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) by considering the range of clinical presentations, neuropathology and the strength of evidence for CTE as a distinct syndrome. Seven electronic databases were searched using a combination of MeSH terms and key words to identify relevant articles. Specific inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to select studies for review. Data extracted where present included study population, exposure/outcome measures, clinical data, neurological examination findings, cognitive assessment, investigation results and neuropathology results. The data from 158 published case studies were reviewed. Critical differences between the older descriptions of CTE (the 'classic' syndrome) and the recent descriptions (the 'modern' syndrome) exist in the age of onset, natural history, clinical features, pathological findings and diagnostic criteria, which suggests that modern CTE is a different syndrome. The methodology of the current studies does not allow determination of aetiology or risk factors. The clinicopathological differences between the 'classic' CTE syndrome and the 'modern' syndrome suggest that the new syndrome needs a different nomenclature. Further research is required to clearly define the clinical phenotype of the modern CTE syndrome and establish the underlying aetiology. Future research needs to address these issues through large-scale, prospective clinicopathological studies. "
2014-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has received widespread media attention and is treated in the lay press as an established disease, characterized by suicidality and progressive dementia. The extant literature on CTE is reviewed here. There currently are no controlled epidemiological data to suggest that retired athletes are at increased risk for dementia or that they exhibit any type of unique neuropathology. There remain no established clinical or pathological criteria for diagnosing CTE. Despite claims that CTE occurs frequently in retired National Football League (NFL) players, recent studies of NFL retirees report that they have an all-cause mortality rate that is approximately half of the expected rate, and even lower suicide rates. In addition, recent clinical studies of samples of cognitively impaired NFL retirees have failed to identify any unique clinical syndrome. Until further controlled studies are completed, it appears to be premature to consider CTE a verifiable disease.  "
2014-01-01,"The accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) is a neuropathological hallmark of tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy, but effective therapies directly targeting the tau protein are currently lacking. Herein, we describe a novel mechanism in which the acetylation of tau on KXGS motifs inhibits phosphorylation on this same motif, and also prevents tau aggregation. Using a site-specific antibody to detect acetylation of KXGS motifs, we demonstrate that these sites are hypoacetylated in patients with AD, as well as a mouse model of tauopathy, suggesting that loss of acetylation on KXGS motifs renders tau vulnerable to pathogenic insults. Furthermore, we identify histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) as the enzyme responsible for the deacetylation of these residues, and provide proof of concept that acute treatment with a selective and blood-brain barrier-permeable HDAC6 inhibitor enhances acetylation and decreases phosphorylation on tau's KXGS motifs in vivo. As such, we have uncovered a novel therapeutic pathway that can be manipulated to block the formation of pathogenic tau species in disease.  "
2014-04-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common form of head injury and is a leading cause of death worldwide. Due to the vast variability in the types and severity of trauma, the cellular consequences of head injury are not completely understood. The development of reliable models of TBI will aid in understanding the molecular consequences of head trauma, and they will assist in identifying biological surrogate markers of the degree of damage and prognosis. In doing so, effective therapeutic strategies can be applied. Current in vivo experimental models yield important information, but they too have a significant amount of variation. The goal of this review is to re-evaluate the use of these in vivo models of TBI and assess whether they correlate with the consequence of TBI in humans from the perspective of tau, an axonal microtubule-stabilizing protein. We present and discuss the current models of traumatic head injury, and we focus on those that assess changes in tau. We evaluate reports of TBI in humans that measured changes in tau and that were detectable in serum and cerebrospinal fluid, and as a pathological consequence in brain tissue.  "
2014-02-01,"Sports involving repeated head trauma are associated with risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Among the behavioral manifestations of CTE is increased impulsiveness. Here, the authors investigate the relationship between impulsiveness and exposure to head trauma in a large group of active professional fighters. Fighters tended to report less impulsiveness than did non-fighting control respondents. Overall, greater fight exposure was associated with higher levels of a specific form of impulsiveness, although there were differences between mixed martial arts fighters and boxers. Fight exposure was associated with reduction in volume of certain brain structures, and these changes were also associated with impulsiveness patterns. Longitudinal studies of professional fighters are important to understand the risk for neuropsychiatric problems.  "
2014-10-01,"We review the current topic in sports-related head injuries including acute subdural hematoma (ASDH), concussion, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Sports-related ASDH is a leading cause of death and severe morbidity in popular contact sports like American football in the USA and judo in Japan. It is thought that rotational acceleration is most likely to produce not only cerebral concussion but also ASDH due to the rupture of a parasagittal bridging vein, depending on the severity of the rotational acceleration injury. Repeated sports head injuries increase the risk for future concussion, cerebral swelling, ASDH or CTE. To avoid fatal consequences or CTE resulting from repeated concussions, an understanding of the criteria for a safe post-concussion return to play (RTP) is essential. Once diagnosed with a concussion, the athlete must not be allowed to RTP the same day and should not resume play before the concussion symptoms have completely resolved. If brain damage has been confirmed or a subdural hematoma is present, the athlete should not be allowed to participate in any contact sports. As much remains unknown regarding the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of sports-related concussion, ASDH, and CTE, basic and clinical studies are necessary to elucidate the crucial issues in sports-related head injuries.  "
2014-06-01,"A link between mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and neurodegenerative diseases, specifically Alzheimer's disease and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), has long been suspected. Shared clinical symptomology - most notably the prominent role of central auditory dysfunction and sleep-wake disturbances in both disease states - and similar findings on postmortem pathological examination has further reinforced suspected commonality between these seemingly disparate entities. However, conventional imaging techniques, including computed tomography and anatomic magnetic resonance, are unable to detect the symptomatic injuries in mTBI patients and therefore detection of neurodegenerative changes in vivo has previously not been reported. Recent research using diffusion tensor imaging, a novel imaging technique, and focused on patient-reported symptoms has for the first time demonstrated imaging findings in mTBI patients in vivo that are strikingly similar to Alzheimer's dementia and CTE. Moving forward, research will focus on identifying what renders certain patients with mTBI susceptible to developing full-fledged Alzheimer's disease and CTE later in life. "
2014-06-01,"The aim of this report is to illustrate the utility of neurocognitive testing as an investigative method to establish the presence of persistent effects of concussive brain injury amongst players of a contact sport with high risk of such injury. The report reviews the outcomes of three previously published neuropsychological studies on South African Rugby Union (hereafter 'rugby') from school through to the national adult level. The diagnostic utility of differential effects per se, as well as differential practice effects on visuomotor function, as a means of distinguishing poorer neurocognitive outcome for rugby versus demographically equivalent noncontact sports players, is described. From various methodological angles, at each level of play, the reviewed studies attest to the presence of long-term vulnerability in visuomotor speed in association with participation in rugby, in turn implicating diffuse frontotemporal dysfunction due to repetitive concussive and subconcussive injury amongst rugby players. As visuomotor speed is a prime function called upon for optimal scholastic and occupational performance, the robustly demonstrated decrement is of immediate clinical importance. Of critical heuristic relevance, however, is evidence of residual brain dysfunction in association with rugby as early as school level, which may ultimately be the precursor of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. "
2014-06-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome, which is caused by single, episodic, or repetitive blunt force impacts to the head and transfer of acceleration-deceleration forces to the brain. CTE presents clinically as a composite syndrome of mood disorders and behavioral and cognitive impairment, with or without sensorimotor impairment. Symptoms of CTE may begin with persistent symptoms of acute traumatic brain injury (TBI) following a documented episode of brain trauma or after a latent period that may range from days to weeks to months and years, up to 40 years following a documented episode of brain trauma or cessation of repetitive TBI. Posttraumatic encephalopathy is distinct from CTE, can be comorbid with CTE, and is a clinicopathologic syndrome induced by focal and/or diffuse, gross and/or microscopic destruction of brain tissue following brain trauma. The brain of a CTE sufferer may appear grossly unremarkable, but shows microscopic evidence of primary and secondary proteinopathies. The primary proteinopathy of CTE is tauopathy, while secondary proteinopathies may include, but are not limited to, amyloidopathy and TDP proteinopathy. Reported prevalence rates of CTE in cohorts exposed to TBI ranges from 3 to 80% across age groups. "
2014-06-01,"No topic in sports has gathered more attention and publicity than the diagnosis, management, and long-term effects of cerebral concussion. The relevant history of concussion starts in 1905 when President Theodore Roosevelt drew attention to the football 'death harvest'. Soon after, rules started to change to reduce the amount and severity of head injuries in football. Up until 1980, the primary focus regarding concussions was to diagnose a potentially fatal intracranial hemorrhage. While aware of long-term consequences of concussions, the perception at the time was that virtually all concussions would 'clear' with time and rest. Concussion management guidelines gave way to objective neuropsychological testing in the early 1990s with the development of the ImPACT™ (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) neurocognitive test. Led by organized football, in 1994 the National Football League (NFL) formed the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee which began to investigate the cause of concussions, evaluate equipment (particularly helmets), and recommend methods for prevention. In 2005, the first case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy was described in a deceased football player, raising concerns about the long-term consequences of head injuries and concussions. Major advancements in contact sports and the military are underway to reduce the incidence of concussions and subconcussive blows to the head. "
2016-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a serious public health concern and a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Each year, an estimated 1.7 million Americans sustain TBI of which ~52,000 people die, ~275,000 people are hospitalized and 1,365,000 people are treated as emergency outpatients. Currently there are ~5.3 million Americans living with TBI. TBI is more of a disease process than of an event that is associated with immediate and long-term sensomotor, psychological and cognitive impairments. TBI is the best known established epigenetic risk factor for later development of neurodegenerative diseases and dementia. People sustaining TBI are ~4 times more likely to develop dementia at a later stage than people without TBI. Single brain injury is linked to later development of symptoms resembling Alzheimer's disease while repetitive brain injuries are linked to later development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and/or Dementia Pugilistica (DP). Furthermore, genetic background of ß-amyloid precursor protein (APP), Apolipoprotein E (ApoE), presenilin (PS) and neprilysin (NEP) genes is associated with exacerbation of neurodegenerative process after TBI. This review encompasses acute effects and chronic neurodegenerative consequences after TBI.  "
2013-12-01,"Our objective was to describe a unique national resource to facilitate amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research, the Department of Veterans Affairs Biorepository Brain Bank. Enrolled veterans receive biannual telephone follow-up to collect clinical data until death including the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). A comprehensive post mortem examination is performed and a wide range of fixed and frozen brain and spinal cord samples are banked. As of December 2012, 240 veterans were enrolled from 47 states and post mortem tissue recoveries were performed on 100 veterans from 37 states. Average disease duration was 13.5 (range 3-45) years. Average follow-up for living subjects was 3.1 years and average ALSFRS-R score was 23.5 compared to 25.9 (12-24 months earlier), indicating slow disease progression. ALS was confirmed by post mortem examination in 97% of cases. Eighty-six percent of cases were TDP-43-positive. Additional neuropathological diagnoses include Lewy body disease (13%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration (6.3%), chronic traumatic encephalopathy with motor neuron disease (3.2%), and Alzheimer's disease (2.1%). Tissue RIN values were ≥ 4.0 in 88% of cases. In conclusion, the availability of high quality fixed and frozen CNS tissue from this well characterized cohort is an important resource to facilitate research into genetic and environmental risk factors and clinical pathological relationships in ALS.

2013-12-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE, previously called punch drunk and dementia pugilistica) has a rich history in the medical literature in association with boxing, but has only recently been recognized with other contact sports, such as football and ice hockey, as well as with military blast injuries. CTE is thought to be a neurodegenerative disease associated with repeated concussive and subconcussive blows to the head. There is characteristic gross and microscopic pathology found in the brain, including frontal and temporal atrophy, axonal degeneration, and hyperphosphorylated tau and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathology. Clinically, there are characteristic progressive deficits in cognition (memory, executive dysfunction), behavior (explosivity, aggression), mood (depression, suicidality), and motor function (parkinsonism), which correlate with the anatomic distribution of brain pathology. While CTE shares clinical and neuropathological traits with other neurodegenerative diseases, the clinical syndrome and the neuropathology as a whole are distinct from other neurodegenerative diseases. Here we review the CTE literature to date. We also draw on the literature from mild traumatic brain injury and other neurodegenerative dementias, particularly when these studies provide guidance for future CTE research. We conclude by suggesting seven essential areas for future CTE research.  "
2013-12-01,"Sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is one of the most devastating neurological diseases; most patients die within 3 to 4 years after symptom onset. Oxidative stress is a disturbance in the pro-oxidative/antioxidative balance favoring the pro-oxidative state. Autopsy and laboratory studies in ALS indicate that oxidative stress plays a major role in motor neuron degeneration and astrocyte dysfunction. Oxidative stress biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid, plasma, and urine are elevated, suggesting that abnormal oxidative stress is generated outside of the central nervous system. Our review indicates that agricultural chemicals, heavy metals, military service, professional sports, excessive physical exertion, chronic head trauma, and certain foods might be modestly associated with ALS risk, with a stronger association between risk and smoking. At the cellular level, these factors are all involved in generating oxidative stress. Experimental studies indicate that a combination of insults that induce modest oxidative stress can exert additive deleterious effects on motor neurons, suggesting that multiple exposures in real-world environments are important. As the disease progresses, nutritional deficiency, cachexia, psychological stress, and impending respiratory failure may further increase oxidative stress. Moreover, accumulating evidence suggests that ALS is possibly a systemic disease. Laboratory, pathologic, and epidemiologic evidence clearly supports the hypothesis that oxidative stress is central in the pathogenic process, particularly in genetically susceptive individuals. If we are to improve ALS treatment, well-designed biochemical and genetic epidemiological studies, combined with a multidisciplinary research approach, are needed and will provide knowledge crucial to our understanding of ALS etiology, pathophysiology, and prognosis.

2013-12-01,"It has been theorized that a career in contact sports may be associated with long-term neurodegenerative changes. This idea dates as far back as the 1920s, was initially reported in boxers, colloquially termed 'punch drunk,' later more formally termed dementia pugilistica (DP), and now coined chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Despite considerable ongoing interest on this topic, there is so far only limited evidence showing an association between sport-related concussion (SRC) and increased risk for late-life cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment, with no causality or risk factors yet determined. The modern CTE description is nevertheless proposed as a unique tauopathy with characteristic pathological stages occurring in retired athletes who have experienced previous repetitive brain trauma. This review highlights the principal issues that so far preclude firm conclusions about the association of athletic head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases of any type. We consider alternative interpretations that may contribute to the clinical progressive neurological findings in some athletes and recommend carefully-controlled epidemiological work to overcome current limitations in this area of research and stimulate future research.

These reports are difficult to reconcile with several decades of research on the science of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and its consequences, especially the natural history and prognosis of mild TBI. This article attempts to reconcile these sources by reviewing the state of the science on CTE, with particular attention to case definitions and neuropathological criteria for this diagnosis. The evidence for links between TBI, CTE, and catastrophic clinical events is explored, and the complexity of attributing rare frequency behavioral events to CTE is highlighted. The clinical and medicolegal implications of the best available evidence are discussed, concluding with a cautionary note against prematurely generalizing current findings on CTE to entire populations of persons with, or at risk for, concussion exposures.

2013-11-01,"The prevalence of psychiatric conditions among elite athletes is still under debate. More and more evidence has accumulated that high-performance athletes are not protected from mental disorders as previously thought. The authors discuss the issue of the sport specificity of selected mental diseases in elite athletes. Specific aspects of eating disorders, exercise addiction, chronic traumatic encephalopathy and mood disorders in the context of overtraining syndrome are examined. In particular, the interrelationship between life and work characteristics unique to elite athletes and the development of mental disorders are reviewed. Differences of clinical presentation and some therapeutic consequences are discussed. The authors suggest that the physical and mental strains endured by elite athletes might influence the onset and severity of their psychiatric disorder. Beside the existing research strategies dealing with the amount of exercise, its intensity and lack of recreation experienced by athletes, further research on psycho-social factors is needed to better understand the sport-specific aetiology of mental disorders in high-performance athletes.  "
2013-11-01,"Research now suggests that head impacts commonly occur during contact sports in which visible signs or symptoms of neurological dysfunction may not develop despite those impacts having the potential for neurological injury. Recent biophysics studies utilizing helmet accelerometers have indicated that athletes at the collegiate and high school levels sustain a surprisingly high number of head impacts ranging from several hundred to well over 1000 during the course of a season. The associated cumulative impact burdens over the course of a career are equally important. Clinical studies have also identified athletes with no readily observable symptoms but who exhibit functional impairment as measured by neuropsychological testing and functional MRI. Such findings have been corroborated by diffusion tensor imaging studies demonstrating axonal injury in asymptomatic athletes at the end of a season. Recent autopsy data have shown that there are subsets of athletes in contact sports who do not have a history of known or identified concussions but nonetheless have neurodegenerative pathology consistent with chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Finally, emerging laboratory data have demonstrated significant axonal injury, blood-brain barrier permeability, and evidence of neuroinflammation, all in the absence of behavioral changes. Such data suggest that subconcussive level impacts can lead to significant neurological alterations, especially if the blows are repetitive. The authors propose ""subconcussion"" as a significant emerging concept requiring thorough consideration of the potential role it plays in accruing sufficient anatomical and/or physiological damage in athletes and military personnel, such that the effects of these injuries are clinically expressed either contemporaneously or later in life.  "
2013-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a substantial health issue worldwide, yet the mechanisms responsible for its complex spectrum of pathologies remains largely unknown. To investigate the mechanisms underlying TBI pathologies, we developed a model of TBI in Drosophila melanogaster. The model allows us to take advantage of the wealth of experimental tools available in flies. Closed head TBI was inflicted with a mechanical device that subjects flies to rapid acceleration and deceleration. Similar to humans with TBI, flies with TBI exhibited temporary incapacitation, ataxia, activation of the innate immune response, neurodegeneration, and death. Our data indicate that TBI results in death shortly after a primary injury only if the injury exceeds a certain threshold and that age and genetic background, but not sex, substantially affect this threshold. Furthermore, this threshold also appears to be dependent on the same cellular and molecular mechanisms that control normal longevity. This study demonstrates the potential of flies for providing key insights into human TBI that may ultimately provide unique opportunities for therapeutic intervention.  "
2013-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. An epidemiological association between head injury and long-term cognitive decline has been described for many years and recent clinical studies have highlighted functional impairment within 12 months of a mild head injury. In addition chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a recently described condition in cases of repetitive head injury. There are shared mechanisms between traumatic brain injury and Alzheimer's disease, and it has been hypothesized that neuroinflammation, in the form of microglial activation, may be a mechanism underlying chronic neurodegenerative processes after traumatic brain injury. This study assessed the microglial reaction after head injury in a range of ages and survival periods, from <24-h survival through to 47-year survival. Immunohistochemistry for reactive microglia (CD68 and CR3/43) was performed on human autopsy brain tissue and assessed 'blind' by quantitative image analysis. Head injury cases were compared with age matched controls, and within the traumatic brain injury group cases with diffuse traumatic axonal injury were compared with cases without diffuse traumatic axonal injury. A major finding was a neuroinflammatory response that develops within the first week and persists for several months after traumatic brain injury, but has returned to control levels after several years. In cases with diffuse traumatic axonal injury the microglial reaction is particularly pronounced in the white matter. These results demonstrate that prolonged microglial activation is a feature of traumatic brain injury, but that the neuroinflammatory response returns to control levels after several years. "
2013-09-01,"The goal of this study was to examine the clinical presentation of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in neuropathologically confirmed cases. Thirty-six adult male subjects were selected from all cases of neuropathologically confirmed CTE at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy brain bank. Subjects were all athletes, had no comorbid neurodegenerative or motor neuron disease, and had next-of-kin informants to provide retrospective reports of the subjects' histories and clinical presentations. These interviews were conducted blind to the subjects' neuropathologic findings. A triad of cognitive, behavioral, and mood impairments was common overall, with cognitive deficits reported for almost all subjects. Three subjects were asymptomatic at the time of death. Consistent with earlier case reports of boxers, 2 relatively distinct clinical presentations emerged, with one group whose initial features developed at a younger age and involved behavioral and/or mood disturbance (n = 22), and another group whose initial presentation developed at an older age and involved cognitive impairment (n = 11). This suggests there are 2 major clinical presentations of CTE, one a behavior/mood variant and the other a cognitive variant. "
2013-09-01,"It has been hypothesized that exposure to repetitive head trauma from contact sports over a long-playing career may eventuate in an increased risk of late-life cognitive impairment. There are currently two competing hypotheses about the possible mechanism underlying such impairment. One is the presence of a unique neurodegenerative disorder known as ‘‘chronic traumatic encephalopathy’’ (CTE). The other is diminished cerebral reserve leading to the earlier clinical expression of age-related neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer’s disease(AD). The present study examined informant AD8 inventory data in a sample of 513 retired National Football League(NFL) players. These data were indicative of possible cognitive impairment in 35.1% of this relatively young sample. A comparison of neurocognitive profiles in a subsample of this group to a clinical sample of patients with a diagnosis of MCI due to AD revealed a highly similar profile of impairments. Overall, the data suggest that there may be an increased prevalence of late-life cognitive impairment in retired NFL players, which may reflect diminished cerebral reserve. The findings are considered preliminary, but emphasize the need for larger, controlled studies on this issue. "
2013-09-01,"A bomb blast may cause the full severity range of traumatic brain injury (TBI), from mild concussion to severe, penetrating injury. The pathophysiology of blast-related TBI is distinctive, with injury magnitude dependent on several factors, including blast energy and distance from the blast epicentre. The prevalence of blast-related mild TBI in modern war zones has varied widely, but detection is optimised by battlefield assessment of concussion and follow-up screening of all personnel with potential concussive events. There is substantial overlap between post-concussive syndrome and post-traumatic stress disorder, and blast-related mild TBI seems to increase the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. Post-concussive syndrome, post-traumatic stress disorder, and chronic pain are a clinical triad in this patient group. Persistent impairment after blast-related mild TBI might be largely attributable to psychological factors, although a causative link between repeated mild TBIs caused by blasts and chronic traumatic encephalopathy has not been established. The application of advanced neuroimaging and the identification of specific molecular biomarkers in serum for diagnosis and prognosis are rapidly advancing, and might help to further categorise these injuries.  "
2013-07-01,"The purpose of this article is to review the history of head injuries in relation to American-style football play, summarize recent research that has linked football head injuries to neurodegeneration, and provide a discussion of the next steps for refining the examination of neurodegeneration in football players. For most of the history of football, the focus of media reports and scientific studies on football-related head injuries was on the acute or short-term effects of serious, traumatic head injuries. Beginning about 10 years ago, a growing concern developed among neurologists and researchers about the long-term effects that playing professional football has on the neurologic health of the players. Autopsy-based studies identified a pathologically distinct neurodegenerative disorder, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, among athletes who were known to have experienced concussive and subconcussive blows to the head during their playing careers. Football players have been well represented in these autopsy findings. A mortality study of a large cohort of retired professional football players found a significantly increased risk of death from neurodegeneration. Further analysis found that non-line players were at higher risk than line players, possibly because of an increased risk of concussion. Although the results of the studies reviewed do not establish a cause effect relationship between football-related head injury and neurodegenerative disorders, a growing body of research supports the hypothesis that professional football players are at an increased risk of neurodegeneration. Significant progress has been made in the last few years on detecting and defining the pathology of neurodegenerative diseases. However, less progress has been made on other factors related to the progression of those diseases in football players. This review identifies three areas for further research: (a) quantification of exposure - a consensus is needed on the use of clinically practical measurements of blows to the head among football players; (b) genetic susceptibility factors - a more rigorous set of unbiased epidemiological and clinical studies is needed before any causal relationships can be drawn between suspected genetic factors, head injury, and neurodegeneration; and (c) earlier detection and prevention of neurodegenerative diseases.

2013-07-01,"Repetitive head trauma is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease and is the primary cause of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. However, little is known about the natural history of, and risk factors for, chronic traumatic encephalopathy or about means of early detection and intervention. The Professional Fighters Brain Health Study is a longitudinal study of active professional fighters (boxers and mixed martial artists), retired professional fighters, and controls matched for age and level of education. The main objective of the Professional Fighters Brain Health Study is to determine the relationships between measures of head trauma exposure and other potential modifiers and changes in brain imaging and neurological and behavioral function over time. The study is designed to extend over 5 years, and we anticipate enrollment of more than 400 boxers and mixed martial artists. Participants will undergo annual evaluations that include 3-tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanning, computerized cognitive assessments, speech analysis, surveys of mood and impulsivity, and blood sampling for genotyping and exploratory biomarker studies. Statistical models will be developed and validated to predict early and progressive changes in brain structure and function. A composite fight exposure index, developed as a summary measure of cumulative traumatic exposure, shows promise as a predictor of brain volumes and cognitive function.  "
2013-07-01,"Repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), such as that experienced by contact-sport athletes, has been associated with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Executive dysfunction is believed to be among the earliest symptoms of CTE, with these symptoms presenting in the fourth or fifth decade of life. The present study used a well-validated self-report measure to study executive functioning in football players, compared to healthy adults. Sixty-four college and professional football players were administered the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, adult version (BRIEF-A) to evaluate nine areas of executive functioning. Scores on the BRIEF-A were compared to published age-corrected normative scores for healthy adults Relative to healthy adults, the football players indicated significantly more problems overall and on seven of the nine clinical scales, including Inhibit, Shift, Emotional Control, Initiate, Working Memory, Plan/Organize, and Task Monitor. These symptoms were greater in athletes 40 and older, relative to younger players. In sum, football players reported more-frequent problems with executive functioning and these symptoms may develop or worsen in the fifth decade of life. The findings are in accord with a growing body of evidence that participation in football is associated with the development of cognitive changes and dementia as observed in CTE. "
2013-07-01,"With as many as 300,000 United States troops in Iraq and Afghanistan having suffered head injuries (Miller, 2012), traumatic brain injury (TBI) has garnered much recent attention. While the cause and severity of these injuries is variable, severe cases can lead to lifelong disability or even death. While aging is the greatest risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is now becoming clear that a history of TBI predisposes the individual to AD later in life (Sivanandam and Thakur, 2012). In this review article, we begin by defining hallmark pathological features of AD and the various forms of TBI. Putative mechanisms underlying the risk relationship between these two neurological disorders are then critically considered. Such mechanisms include precipitation and 'spreading' of cerebral amyloid pathology and the role of neuroinflammation. The combined problems of TBI and AD represent significant burdens to public health. A thorough, mechanistic understanding of the precise relationship between TBI and AD is of utmost importance in order to illuminate new therapeutic targets. Mechanistic investigations and the development of preclinical therapeutics are reliant upon a clearer understanding of these human diseases and accurate modeling of pathological hallmarks in animal systems.  "
2013-07-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in significant disability due to cognitive deficits particularly in attention, learning and memory, and higher-order executive functions. The role of TBI in chronic neurodegeneration and the development of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and most recently chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is of particular importance. However, despite significant effort very few therapeutic options exist to prevent or reverse cognitive impairment following TBI. In this review, we present experimental evidence of the known secondary injury mechanisms which contribute to neuronal cell loss, axonal injury, and synaptic dysfunction and hence cognitive impairment both acutely and chronically following TBI. In particular we focus on the mechanisms linking TBI to the development of two forms of dementia: AD and CTE. We provide evidence of potential molecular mechanisms involved in modulating Aβ and Tau following TBI and provide evidence of the role of these mechanisms in AD pathology. Additionally we propose a mechanism by which Aβ generated as a direct result of TBI is capable of exacerbating secondary injury mechanisms thereby establishing a neurotoxic cascade that leads to chronic neurodegeneration.  "
2013-07-01,"Mild head injury is of interest because of a history of under diagnosis and underestimated clinical importance. Half of the patients with mild head injuries or concussions have sport-related injuries. Knowledge of symptoms and appropriate management can be improved and is a matter of practical interest. Several algorithms exist for discharge, admission or for cranial computed tomography (CT).These employ different risk factors and calculate their sensitivity of correctly identifying children with traumatic brain injury (TBI). In contrast, a multicenter, prospective study in the United States developed a prediction model to diagnose the absence of intracranial injury when certain symptoms are missing (negative prediction value). An acute concussion presents with a combination of physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms, which are usually self-limited. In young athletes, a second impact before full recovery from the first may have deleterious consequences and should be avoided by strict ""return to play"" rules. Recent research suggests that repetitive minor hits may cause delayed brain damage (dementia pugilistica, ""punch-drunk syndrome""). A link to neurodegenerative diseases such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease and parkinsonism (tauopathies) is described by amyloid β plaques in the brain of such patients. A genetic predisposition (apolipoprotein) is discussed. This review focuses on the rules attempting to determine the need for cranial CT in the emergency department and the impact of mild head injuries in young athletes. We describe in detail standardized guidelines for appropriate diagnosis and treatment and discuss the association between repetitive minor injuries and chronic traumatic encephalopathy and neurodegenerative diseases.  "
2013-07-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) in early to mid-life is associated with an increased risk of dementia in late life. It is unclear whether TBI results in acceleration of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like pathology or has features of another dementing condition, such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy, which is associated with more-prominent mood, behavior, and motor disturbances than AD. Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set was obtained over a 5-year period. Categorical data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. Continuous parametric data were analyzed using the Student's t-test. Nonparametric data were analyzed using Mann-Whitney's test. Overall, 877 individuals with dementia who had sustained TBI were identified in the NACC database. Only TBI with chronic deficit or dysfunction was associated with increased risk of dementia. Patients with dementia after TBI (n=62) were significantly more likely to experience depression, anxiety, irritability, and motor disorders than patients with probable AD. Autopsy data were available for 20 of the 62 TBI patients. Of the patients with TBI, 62% met National Institute of Aging-Reagan Institute ""high likelihood"" criteria for AD. We conclude that TBI with chronic deficit or dysfunction is associated with an increased odds ratio for dementia. Clinically, patients with dementia associated with TBI were more likely to have symptoms of depression, agitation, irritability, and motor dysfunction than patients with probable AD. These findings suggest that dementia in individuals with a history of TBI may be distinct from AD. "
2013-06-01,"Boxing and other combat sports may serve as a human model to study the effects of repetitive head trauma on brain structure and function. The initial description of what is now known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was reported in boxers in 1928. In the ensuing years, studies examining boxers have described the clinical features of CTE, its relationship to degree of exposure to fighting, and an array of radiologic findings. The field has been hampered by issues related to study design, lack of longitudinal follow-up, and absence of agreed-upon clinical criteria for CTE. A recently launched prospective cohort study of professional fighters, the Professional Fighters Brain Health Study, attempts to overcome some of the problems in studying fighters. Here, we review the cross-sectional results from the first year of the project.  "
2013-06-01,"Abstract Explosive blast-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the signature insult in modern combat casualty care and has been linked to post-traumatic stress disorder, memory loss, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. In this article we report on blast-induced mild TBI (mTBI) characterized by fiber-tract degeneration and axonal injury revealed by cupric silver staining in adult male rats after head-only exposure to 35 psi in a helium-driven shock tube with head restraint. We now explore pathways of secondary injury and repair using biochemical/molecular strategies. Injury produced ∼25% mortality from apnea. Shams received identical anesthesia exposure. Rats were sacrificed at 2 or 24 h, and brain was sampled in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. Hippocampal samples were used to assess gene array (RatRef-12 Expression BeadChip; Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA) and oxidative stress (OS; ascorbate, glutathione, low-molecular-weight thiols [LMWT], protein thiols, and 4-hydroxynonenal [HNE]). Cortical samples were used to assess neuroinflammation (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors; Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) and purines (adenosine triphosphate [ATP], adenosine diphosphate, adenosine, inosine, 2'-AMP [adenosine monophosphate], and 5'-AMP). Gene array revealed marked increases in astrocyte and neuroinflammatory markers at 24 h (glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin, and complement component 1) with expression patterns bioinformatically consistent with those noted in Alzheimer's disease and long-term potentiation. Ascorbate, LMWT, and protein thiols were reduced at 2 and 24 h; by 24 h, HNE was increased. At 2 h, multiple cytokines and chemokines (interleukin [IL]-1α, IL-6, IL-10, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha [MIP-1α]) were increased; by 24 h, only MIP-1α remained elevated. ATP was not depleted, and adenosine correlated with 2'-cyclic AMP (cAMP), and not 5'-cAMP. Our data reveal (1) gene-array alterations similar to disorders of memory processing and a marked astrocyte response, (2) OS, (3) neuroinflammation with a sustained chemokine response, and (4) adenosine production despite lack of energy failure-possibly resulting from metabolism of 2'-3'-cAMP. A robust biochemical/molecular response occurs after blast-induced mTBI, with the body protected from blast and the head constrained to limit motion. "
2013-05-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is the term coined for the neurodegenerative disease often suspected in athletes with histories of repeated concussion and progressive dementia. Histologically, CTE is defined as a tauopathy with a distribution of tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that is distinct from other tauopathies, and usually shows an absence of beta-amyloid deposits, in contrast to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although the connection between repeated concussions and CTE-type neurodegeneration has been recently proposed, this causal relationship has not yet been firmly established. Also, the prevalence of CTE among athletes with multiple concussions is unknown. We performed a consecutive case series brain autopsy study on six retired professional football players from the Canadian Football League (CFL) with histories of multiple concussions and significant neurological decline. All participants had progressive neurocognitive decline prior to death; however, only 3 cases had post-mortem neuropathological findings consistent with CTE. The other 3 participants had pathological diagnoses of AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the CTE cases showed co-morbid pathology of cancer, vascular disease, and AD. Our case studies highlight that not all athletes with history of repeated concussions and neurological symptomology present neuropathological changes of CTE. These preliminary findings support the need for further research into the link between concussion and CTE as well as the need to expand the research to other possible causes of taupathy in athletes. They point to a critical need for prospective studies with good sampling methods to allow us to understand the relationship between multiple concussions and the development of CTE. "
2013-05-01,"Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a global health concern. The majority of TBI's are mild, yet our ability to diagnose and treat mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is lacking. This deficiency results from a variety of issues including the difficulty in interpreting ambiguous clinically presented symptoms, and ineffective imaging techniques. Thus, researchers have begun to explore cellular and molecular based approaches to improve both diagnosis and prognosis. This has been met with a variety of challenges, including difficulty in relating biological markers to current clinical symptoms, and overcoming our lack of fundamental understanding of the pathophysiology of mTBI. However, recent adoption of high throughput technologies and a change in focus from the identification of single to multiple markers has given just optimism to mTBI research. The purpose of this review is to highlight a number of current experimental peripheral blood biomarkers of mTBI, as well as comment on the issues surrounding their clinical application and utility. "
2013-04-01,"Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) results from a transfer of mechanical energy into the brain from traumatic events such as rapid acceleration/deceleration, a direct impact to the head, or an explosive blast. Transfer of energy into the brain can cause structural, physiological, and/or functional changes in the brain that may yield neurological, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms that can be long-lasting. Because mTBI can cause these symptoms in the absence of positive neuroimaging findings, its diagnosis can be subjective and often is based on self-reported neurological symptoms. Further, proper diagnosis can be influenced by the motivation to conceal or embellish signs and/or an inability of the patient to notice subtle dysfunctions or alterations of consciousness. Therefore, appropriate diagnosis of mTBI would benefit from objective indicators of injury. Concussion and mTBI are often used interchangeably, with concussion being primarily used in sport medicine, whereas mTBI is used in reference to traumatic injury. This review provides a critical assessment of the status of current biomarkers for the diagnosis of human mTBI. We review the status of biomarkers that have been tested in TBI patients with injuries classified as mild, and introduce a new concept for the discovery of biomarkers (termed symptophenotypes) to predict common and unique symptoms of concussion. Finally, we discuss the need for biomarker/biomarker signatures that can detect mTBI in the context of polytrauma, and to assess the consequences of repeated injury on the development of secondary injury syndrome, prolongation of post-concussion symptoms, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

2013-04-01,"The purpose of this paper was to review the current state of evidence for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in retired athletes and to consider the potential differential diagnoses that require consideration when retired athletes present with cognitive and psychiatric problems. MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, Mosby's Index, PsycEXTRA, PsycINFO and Scopus. Key words included CTE, dementia pugilistica, punch drunk syndrome, traumatic encephalopathy, CTE, repetitive head injury, sports concussion, multiple concussions, chronic concussions, subconcussive blow and sports-related traumatic brain injury. At present, there are no published epidemiological, cross-sectional or prospective studies relating to modern CTE. Owing to the nature of the published studies, being case reports or pathological case series, it is not possible to determine the causality or risk factors with any certainty. As such, the speculation that repeated concussion or subconcussive impacts cause CTE remains unproven. The extent to which age-related changes, psychiatric or mental health illness, alcohol/drug use or coexisting dementing illnesses contribute to this process is largely unaccounted for in the published literature. At present, the interpretation of causation in the modern CTE case studies should proceed cautiously. The causal assumptions require further prospective or longitudinal studies on the topic. "
2013-04-01,"Over the past decade, public awareness of the long-term pathological consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) has increased. Such awareness has been stimulated mainly by reports of progressive neurological dysfunction in athletes exposed to repetitive concussions in high-impact sports such as boxing and American football, and by the rising number of TBIs in war veterans who are now more likely to survive explosive blasts owing to improved treatment. Moreover, the entity of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)--which is marked by prominent neuropsychiatric features including dementia, parkinsonism, depression, agitation, psychosis, and aggression--has become increasingly recognized as a potential late outcome of repetitive TBI. Annually, about 1% of the population in developed countries experiences a clinically relevant TBI. The goal of this Review is to provide an overview of the latest understanding of CTE pathophysiology, and to delineate the key issues that are challenging clinical and research communities, such as accurate quantification of the risk of CTE, and development of reliable biomarkers for single-incident TBI and CTE. "
2013-04-01,"Acute and chronic sports-related traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are a substantial public health concern. Various types of acute TBI can occur in sport, but detection and management of cerebral concussion is of greatest importance as mismanagement of this syndrome can lead to persistent or chronic postconcussion syndrome (CPCS) or diffuse cerebral swelling. Chronic TBI encompasses a spectrum of disorders that are associated with long-term consequences of brain injury, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), dementia pugilistica, post-traumatic parkinsonism, post-traumatic dementia and CPCS. CTE is the prototype of chronic TBI, but can only be definitively diagnosed at autopsy as no reliable biomarkers of this disorder are available. Whether CTE shares neuropathological features with CPCS is unknown. Evidence suggests that participation in contact-collision sports may increase the risk of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, but the data are conflicting. In this Review, the spectrum of acute and chronic sport-related TBI is discussed, highlighting how examination of athletes involved in high-impact sports has advanced our understanding of pathology of brain injury and enabled improvements in detection and diagnosis of sport-related TBI.

2013-04-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has long been recognized to be a risk factor for dementia. This association has, however, only recently gained widespread attention through the increased awareness of 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy' (CTE) in athletes exposed to repetitive head injury. Originally termed 'dementia pugilistica' and linked to a career in boxing, descriptions of the neuropathological features of CTE include brain atrophy, cavum septum pellucidum, and amyloid-β, tau and TDP-43 pathologies, many of which might contribute to clinical syndromes of cognitive impairment. Similar chronic pathologies are also commonly found years after just a single moderate to severe TBI. However, little consensus currently exists on specific features of these post-TBI syndromes that might permit their confident clinical and/or pathological diagnosis. Moreover, the mechanisms contributing to neurodegeneration following TBI largely remain unknown. Here, we review the current literature and controversies in the study of chronic neuropathological changes after TBI. "
2013-04-01,"The neuropathologic findings of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) were first described almost 40 years after the first clinical reports. We reviewed the literature and describe the neuropathological findings seen primarily in professional athletes and more recently, in war veterans. We reviewed the literature of CTE concentrating on references that focused on the correlation of clinical findings with the neuropathologic changes. The pathobiology and proposed mechanisms of injury are described. Diagnostic modalities and various diagnostic criteria of CTE are reviewed. We are beginning to understand the neuropathologic basis of CTE, which appears to be a consequence of repetitive mild brain injuries. There appear to be reproducible criteria for the post-mortem diagnosis of CTE and the neuropathologic findings are becoming more widely accepted. More research is required to elucidate the risk factors that predispose athletes and war veterans to CTE. There is also a need for more diagnostic markers and a method to assess CTE in patients prior to death. The neuropathologic findings of a progressive tauopathy including the presence of numerous neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), rare neuritic plaques, and widespread expression of TDP-43 (transactive response [TAR] DNA binding protein 43) also require further study. The potential prevalence of CTE, as well as the vulnerable populations involved, makes research into this topic crucial. Currently, a comprehensive neurological exam, neuropsychiatric assessment, and standard radiographic techniques such as conventional MRI are the mainstay of diagnosis. There is a pressing need for the prevention of CTE and the development of non-invasive diagnostic tests in order to develop therapies that may be of clinical use to athletes and blast injury veterans during their lifetimes.

2013-04-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death and disability world wide. In the United States alone, nearly 1·7 million individuals are treated in the hospital setting for TBI of all severities, which accounts for over US$48 billion of health care cost annually. This special issue of Neurological Research provides a broad coverage of several important topics in TBI, including contemporary imaging of mild TBI, management of chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH), use of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) to treat TBI, reviews on blast TBI and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), as well as basic science studies in different rodent models of TBI. The authors aim to provide some insight on TBI to neurosurgeons, neurologists, rehabilitation doctors, and other specialists treating TBI patients as well as neuroscientists who are involved in neurotrauma research.

2019-11-01,"The Alberta Prion Research Institute, part of Alberta Innovates Bio Solutions, is proud to host the world's largest international prion research congress, PRION 2013: Conquering Frontiers, in Banff, Alberta, Canada from May 26-29, 2013. PRION 2013 will be only the second time this international meeting has been held outside of Europe since it began in 2004. The PRION 2013 International Scientific Advisory Committee includes leading international scholars and policy advisors in both human and animal protein misfolding research from 12 countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Scotland, Spain and the United States. Prion and protein misfolding science can inform policy, risk management and mitigation, diagnoses and potential treatments in a range of areas from wildlife management to human dementias and neurodegenerative diseases. Compelling evidence is emerging that prion-like mechanisms may underlie a number of the human neurodegenerative diseases and dementias, providing the opportunity to seek out new treatments and for the cross-fertilization of ideas between the two related fields. This approach will be highlighted at PRION 2013. The theme of PRION 2013 is ""Conquering Frontiers."" It will be a continuation of the science covered in previous meetings with an emphasis on looking toward investigations in the new frontiers created by the relationships between prion diseases and human neurodegenerative diseases and dementias. The four-day session features scientific talks, workshops and posters on the following themes: Prion and Prion-like Diseases in Humans; Prion Diseases in Animals; Protein Structure and Biology; and Socioeconomic Impacts. The knowledge exchange that will take place at PRION 2013 will help to shape the future of prion and protein misfolding research and its application around the world. "
2013-02-01,"Extensive tau-immunoreactive neurons and glial cells associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) have been documented in the brains of some professional athletes and others with a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (r-mTBI). The neuropathology and tau involvement in mTBI have not been extensively studied in animal models, particularly in aged animals. We investigated the effects of single mTBI (s-mTBI) and r-mTBI in 18-month-old hTau mice, which express wild-type human tau isoforms on a null murine tau background (n = 3-5 per group). At this age, hTau mice already demonstrate tau pathology, but there was a significant increase in phospho-tau immunoreactivity in response to r-mTBI, but not to s-mTBI,as determined using multiple phospho-tau-specific antibodies. Repetitive mTBI also resulted in a marked increase in astrocyte/microglia activation notably in the superficial layer of the motor/somatosensory cortex and the corpus callosum. We did not observe the perivascular tau pathology, neuritic threads, or astrocytic tangles that are commonly found in human CTE. The increase in phospho-tau in the r-mTBI mice suggests that this may be a useful model for investigating further the link between mTBI, particularly r-mTBI, and tau pathobiology in CTE and in understanding responses of the aged brain to mTBI.

2013-02-01,"The brain is vulnerable to a number of acute insults, with traumatic brain injury being among the commonest. Neuroinflammation is a common response to acute injury and microglial activation is a key component of the inflammatory response. In the acute and subacute phase it is likely that this response is protective and forms an important part of the normal tissue reaction. However, there is considerable literature demonstrating an association between acute traumatic brain injury to the brain and subsequent cognitive decline. This article will review the epidemiological literature relating to both single and repetitive head injury. It will focus on the neuropathological features associated with long-term complications of a single blunt force head injury, repetitive head injury and blast head injury, with particular reference to chronic traumatic encephalopathy, including dementia pugilistica. Neuroinflammation has been postulated as a key mechanism linking acute traumatic brain injury with subsequent neurodegenerative disease, and this review will consider the response to injury in the acute phase and how this may be detrimental in the longer term, and discuss potential genetic factors which may influence this cellular response. Finally, this article will consider future directions for research and potential future therapies. "
2013-01-01,"The diagnosis of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) upon autopsy in a growing number of athletes and soldiers alike has resulted in increased awareness, by both the scientific/medical and lay communities, of the potential for lasting effects of repetitive traumatic brain injury. While the scientific community has come to better understand the clinical presentation and underlying pathophysiology of CTE, the diagnosis of CTE remains autopsy-based, which prevents adequate monitoring and tracking of the disease. The lack of established biomarkers or imaging modalities for diagnostic and prognostic purposes also prevents the development and implementation of therapeutic protocols. In this work the clinical history and pathologic findings associated with CTE are reviewed, as well as imaging modalities that have demonstrated some promise for future use in the diagnosis and/or tracking of CTE or repetitive brain injury. Biomarkers under investigation are also discussed with particular attention to the timing of release and potential utility in situations of repetitive traumatic brain injury. Further investigation into imaging modalities and biomarker elucidation for the diagnosis of CTE is clearly both needed and warranted. "
2013-01-01,"When an health condition has been identified, the question of whether to continue driving depends not on a medical diagnosis, but on the functional consequences of the illness. The complex nature of physical and mental impairments and their relationship with safe driving make the availability of evidence based tools necessary for health professionals. The review aims at identifying and summarizing scientific findings concerning the relationship between neuropsychological and clinical screening tests and fitness to drive among people with chronic conditions. Studies were searched for driving ability evaluation by road test or simulator, clinical/neuropsychological examinations of participants with chronic diseases or permanent disablement impairing driving performance, primary outcomes as fatal/non-fatal traffic injuries and secondary outcomes as fitness to drive assessment. Twenty-seven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Some studies included more than one clinical condition. The illness investigated were Alzheimer Disease (n=6), Parkinson Disease (n=8), Cardiovascular Accident (n=4), Traumatic Brain Injuries (n=3), Sleep Apnea Syndrome (n=2), Narcolepsy (n=1), Multiple Sclerosis (n=1) and Hepatic Encephalopathy (n=1), comorbidities (n=3). No studies match inclusion criteria about Myasthenia Gravis, Diabetes Mellitus, Renal Diseases, Hearing Disorders and Sight Diseases. No studies referred to primary outcomes. The selected studies provided opposite evidences. It would be reasonable to argue that some clinical and neuropsychological tests are effective in predicting fitness to drive even if contrasting results support that driving performance decreases as a function of clinical and neuropsychological decline in some chronic diseases. Nevertheless we found no evidence that clinical and neuropsychological screening tests would lead to a reduction in motor vehicle crashes involving chronic disabled drivers. It seems necessary to develop tests with proven validity for identifying high-risk drivers so that physicians can provide guidance to their patients in chronic conditions, and also to medical advisory boards working with licensing offices.

2013-11-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a global health concern, and the recent literature reports that a single mild TBI can result in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). It has been suggested that CTE may lead to death by suicide, raising important prevention, treatment, and policy implications. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of the medical literature to answer the key question: What is the existing evidence in support of a relationship between CTE and suicide? Systematic searches of CTE and suicide yielded 85 unique abstracts. Seven articles were identified for full text review. Only two case series met inclusion criteria and included autopsies from 17 unique cases, 5 of whom died by suicide. Neither studies used blinding, control cases, or systematic data collection regarding TBI exposure and/or medical/neuropsychiatric history. The identified CTE literature revealed divergent opinions regarding neuropathological elements of CTE and heterogeneity regarding clinical manifestations. Overall quality of evidence regarding a relationship between CTE and suicide was rated as very low using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation Working Group (GRADE) criteria. Further studies of higher quality and methodological rigor are needed to determine the existence and nature of any relationship between CTE and suicide.  "
2013-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a progressive tauopathy that occurs as a consequence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury. We analysed post-mortem brains obtained from a cohort of 85 subjects with histories of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury and found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in 68 subjects: all males, ranging in age from 17 to 98 years (mean 59.5 years), including 64 athletes, 21 military veterans (86% of whom were also athletes) and one individual who engaged in self-injurious head banging behaviour. Eighteen age- and gender-matched individuals without a history of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury served as control subjects. In chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the spectrum of hyperphosphorylated tau pathology ranged in severity from focal perivascular epicentres of neurofibrillary tangles in the frontal neocortex to severe tauopathy affecting widespread brain regions, including the medial temporal lobe, thereby allowing a progressive staging of pathology from stages I-IV. Multifocal axonal varicosities and axonal loss were found in deep cortex and subcortical white matter at all stages of chronic traumatic encephalopathy. TAR DNA-binding protein 43 immunoreactive inclusions and neurites were also found in 85% of cases, ranging from focal pathology in stages I-III to widespread inclusions and neurites in stage IV. Symptoms in stage I chronic traumatic encephalopathy included headache and loss of attention and concentration. Additional symptoms in stage II included depression, explosivity and short-term memory loss. In stage III, executive dysfunction and cognitive impairment were found, and in stage IV, dementia, word-finding difficulty and aggression were characteristic. Data on athletic exposure were available for 34 American football players; the stage of chronic traumatic encephalopathy correlated with increased duration of football play, survival after football and age at death. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy was the sole diagnosis in 43 cases (63%); eight were also diagnosed with motor neuron disease (12%), seven with Alzheimer's disease (11%), 11 with Lewy body disease (16%) and four with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (6%). There is an ordered and predictable progression of hyperphosphorylated tau abnormalities through the nervous system in chronic traumatic encephalopathy that occurs in conjunction with widespread axonal disruption and loss. The frequent association of chronic traumatic encephalopathy with other neurodegenerative disorders suggests that repetitive brain trauma and hyperphosphorylated tau protein deposition promote the accumulation of other abnormally aggregated proteins including TAR DNA-binding protein 43, amyloid beta protein and alpha-synuclein.

2013-05-01,"Decompressive craniectomy has been used as a lifesaving procedure for many neurological emergencies, including traumatic brain injury, ischaemic stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage, cerebrovenous thrombosis, severe intracranial infection, inflammatory demyelination and encephalopathy. The evidence to support using decompressive craniectomy in these situations is, however, limited. Decompressive craniectomy has only been evaluated by randomized controlled trials in traumatic brain injury and ischaemic stroke and, even so, its benefits and risks in these situations remain elusive. If one considers a modified Rankin Scale of 4 or 5 or dependency in daily activity as an unfavourable outcome, decompressive craniectomy is associated with an increased risk of survivors with unfavourable outcome (relative risk [RR] = 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.5-5.8, p = 0.002, I(2 )= 0%; number needed to operate to increase an unfavourable outcome = 3.5, 95% CI = 2.4-7.4), but not the number of survivors with a favourable outcome (RR = 1.5, 95% CI = 0.9-2.6, p = 0.13, I(2 )= 0%).

2013-01-01,"While concussions have long been linked to brain and central nervous system issues, a new study suggests that repeated hits to the head-mild or otherwise-can lead to memory loss, depression, and dementia. This postmortem brain study, conducted at the Boston University Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy, provides new and troubling evidence about chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a long-term degenerative and incurable brain disease. Although military personnel and others are vulnerable to the disease, the highest risk is among athletes involved in contact sports in which hits to the head are considered ""part of the game."" "
2013-01-01,"Sports-related concussion has gained increased prominence, in part due to media coverage of several well-known athletes who have died from consequences of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). CTE was first described by Martland in 1928 as a syndrome seen in boxers who had experienced significant head trauma from repeated blows. The classic symptoms of impaired cognition, mood, behavior, and motor skills also have been reported in professional football players, and in 2005, the histopathological findings of CTE were first reported in a former National Football League (NFL) player. These finding were similar to Alzheimer's disease in some ways but differed in critical areas such as a predominance of tau protein deposition over amyloid. The pathophysiology is still unknown but involves a history of repeated concussive and subconcussive blows and then a lag period before CTE symptoms become evident. The involvement of excitotoxic amino acids and abnormal microglial activation remain speculative. Early identification and prevention of this disease by reducing repeated blows to the head has become a critical focus of current research. "
2013-09-01,"The growing awareness of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has the potential to change the public perception and on-field rules of the National Football League (NFL). More than 3,000 ex-NFL players or their relatives are engaged in litigation alleging that the NFL failed to acknowledge and address the neuropsychiatric risks associated with brain injuries that result from playing in the NFL. This article explores the intersection between the medical and legal aspects of CTE in the NFL from a forensic psychiatry perspective.  "

2012-12-01,"The acute and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injury (TBI) have received increased attention in recent years. In this Review, we discuss the neuropathology and neural mechanisms associated with TBI, drawing on findings from sports-induced TBI in athletes, in whom acute TBI damages axons and elicits both regenerative and degenerative tissue responses in the brain and in whom repeated concussions may initiate a long-term neurodegenerative process called dementia pugilistica or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We also consider how the neuropathology and neurobiology of CTE in many ways resembles other neurodegenerative illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease, particularly with respect to mismetabolism and aggregation of tau, β-amyloid, and TDP-43. Finally, we explore how translational research in animal models of acceleration/deceleration types of injury relevant for concussion together with clinical studies employing imaging and biochemical markers may further elucidate the neurobiology of TBI and CTE.

2012-12-01,"There has been a growing interest in the diagnosis and management of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), or concussion. Repetitive concussion and subconcussion have been linked to a spectrum of neurological sequelae, including postconcussion syndrome, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, mild cognitive impairment, and dementia pugilistica. A more common risk than chronic traumatic encephalopathy is the season-ending or career-ending effects of concussion or its mismanagement. To effectively prevent and treat the sequelae of concussion, it will be important to understand the basic processes involved. Reviewed in this paper are the forces behind the primary phase of injury in mild TBI, as well as the immediate and delayed cellular events responsible for the secondary phase of injury leading to neuronal dysfunction and possible cell death. Advanced neuroimaging sequences have recently been developed that have the potential to increase the sensitivity of standard MRI to detect both structural and functional abnormalities associated with concussion, and have provided further insight into the potential underlying pathophysiology. Also discussed are the potential long-term effects of repetitive mild TBI, particularly chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Much of the data regarding this syndrome is limited to postmortem analyses, and at present there is no animal model of chronic traumatic encephalopathy described in the literature. As this arena of TBI research continues to evolve, it will be imperative to appropriately model concussive and even subconcussive injuries in an attempt to understand, prevent, and treat the associated chronic neurodegenerative sequelae.

2012-10-01,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is among the earliest illnesses described in human history and remains a major source of morbidity and mortality in the modern era. It is estimated that 2% of the US population lives with long-term disabilities due to a prior TBI, and incidence and prevalence rates are even higher in developing countries. One of the most feared long-term consequences of TBIs is dementia, as multiple epidemiologic studies show that experiencing a TBI in early or midlife is associated with an increased risk of dementia in late life. The best data indicate that moderate and severe TBIs increase risk of dementia between 2- and 4-fold. It is less clear whether mild TBIs such as brief concussions result in increased dementia risk, in part because mild head injuries are often not well documented and retrospective studies have recall bias. However, it has been observed for many years that multiple mild TBIs as experienced by professional boxers are associated with a high risk of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a type of dementia with distinctive clinical and pathologic features. The recent recognition that CTE is common in retired professional football and hockey players has rekindled interest in this condition, as has the recognition that military personnel also experience high rates of mild TBIs and may have a similar syndrome. It is presently unknown whether dementia in TBI survivors is pathophysiologically similar to Alzheimer disease, CTE, or some other entity. Such information is critical for developing preventive and treatment strategies for a common cause of acquired dementia. Herein, we will review the epidemiologic data linking TBI and dementia, existing clinical and pathologic data, and will identify areas where future research is needed. "
2012-06-01,"Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE) is a neurodegenerative disease thought to be caused, at least in part, by repetitive brain trauma, including concussive and subconcussive injuries. It is thought to result in executive dysfunction, memory impairment, depression and suicidality, apathy, poor impulse control, and eventually dementia. Beyond repetitive brain trauma, the risk factors for CTE remain unknown. CTE is neuropathologically characterized by aggregation and accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and TDP-43. Recent postmortem findings indicate that CTE may affect a broader population than was initially conceptualized, particularly contact sport athletes and those with a history of military combat. Given the large population that could potentially be affected, CTE may represent an important issue in public health. Although there has been greater public awareness brought to the condition in recent years, there are still many research questions that remain. Thus far, CTE can only be diagnosed post-mortem. Current research efforts are focused on the creation of clinical diagnostic criteria, finding objective biomarkers for CTE, and understanding the additional risk factors and underlying mechanism that causes the disease. This review examines research to date and suggests future directions worthy of exploration. "
2012-05-01,"Blast exposure is associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI), neuropsychiatric symptoms, and long-term cognitive disability. We examined a case series of postmortem brains from U.S. military veterans exposed to blast and/or concussive injury. We found evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a tau protein-linked neurodegenerative disease, that was similar to the CTE neuropathology observed in young amateur American football players and a professional wrestler with histories of concussive injuries. We developed a blast neurotrauma mouse model that recapitulated CTE-linked neuropathology in wild-type C57BL/6 mice 2 weeks after exposure to a single blast. Blast-exposed mice demonstrated phosphorylated tauopathy, myelinated axonopathy, microvasculopathy, chronic neuroinflammation, and neurodegeneration in the absence of macroscopic tissue damage or hemorrhage. Blast exposure induced persistent hippocampal-dependent learning and memory deficits that persisted for at least 1 month and correlated with impaired axonal conduction and defective activity-dependent long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission. Intracerebral pressure recordings demonstrated that shock waves traversed the mouse brain with minimal change and without thoracic contributions. Kinematic analysis revealed blast-induced head oscillation at accelerations sufficient to cause brain injury. Head immobilization during blast exposure prevented blast-induced learning and memory deficits. The contribution of blast wind to injurious head acceleration may be a primary injury mechanism leading to blast-related TBI and CTE. These results identify common pathogenic determinants leading to CTE in blast-exposed military veterans and head-injured athletes and additionally provide mechanistic evidence linking blast exposure to persistent impairments in neurophysiological function, learning, and memory.

2012-05-01,"Concussion is a prevalent brain injury in the community. While primary prevention strategies need to be enhanced, it is also important to diagnose and treat concussions expertly and expeditiously to prevent serious complications that may be life-threatening or long lasting. Therefore, physicians should be knowledgeable about the diagnosis and management of concussions. The present study assesses Ontario medical students' and residents' knowledge of concussion management. A survey to assess the knowledge and awareness of the diagnosis and treatment of concussions was developed and administered to graduating medical students (n= 222) and neurology and neurosurgery residents (n = 80) at the University of Toronto. Residents answered correctly significantly more of the questions regarding the diagnosis and management of concussions than the medical students (mean = 5.8 vs 4.1, t= 4.48, p<0.01). Gender, participation in sports, and personal concussion history were not predictive of the number of questions answered correctly. Several knowledge gaps were identified in the sample population as a whole. Approximately half of the medical students and residents did not recognize chronic traumatic encephalopathy (n = 36) or the second impact syndrome (n = 44) as possible consequences of repetitive concussions. Twenty-four percent of the medical students (n = 18) did not think that ""every concussed individual should see a physician"" as part of management. A significant number of medical students and residents have incomplete knowledge about concussion diagnosis and management. This should be addressed by targeting this population during undergraduate medical education. "
2015-11-01,"With preferential use of high explosives in modern warfare, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become a common injury for troops. Most TBIs are classified as ""mild,"" although military personnel with these injuries can have persistent symptoms such as headache, memory impairment, and behavioral changes. During World War I, soldiers in the trenches, undergoing unrelenting artillery bombardment, suffered from similar symptoms, designated at the time as ""shell shock."" Dr Frederick Mott proposed studying the brains of deceased soldiers to elucidate the neuropathology of this clinical entity. Subsequent to a British government enquiry after World War I, the term ""shell shock"" was banned and further investigation into a possible organic cause for these symptoms was discontinued. Nevertheless, similar clinical entities, such as combat or battle fatigue and posttraumatic stress disorder, continue to be encountered by combatants in subsequent military conflicts. To this day, there exists a paucity of neuropathology studies investigating the effects of high explosives on the human brain. By analogy, studies have recently revealed that athletes with repeated head trauma can develop a neurodegenerative disease, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, who present with similar clinical features. Given current circumstance, we propose completing the work envisioned by Dr Mott almost 100 years ago. "
2012-04-01,"Concussion is a growing public health issue in the United States, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is the chief long-term concern linked to repeated concussions. Recently, attention has shifted toward subconcussive blows and the role they may play in the development of CTE. We recruited a cohort of high school football players for two seasons of observation. Acceleration sensors were placed in the helmets, and all contact activity was monitored. Pre-season computer-based neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tests were also obtained in order to assess cognitive and neurophysiological health. In-season follow-up scans were then obtained both from individuals who had sustained a clinically-diagnosed concussion and those who had not. These changes were then related through stepwise regression to history of blows recorded throughout the football season up to the date of the scan. In addition to those subjects who had sustained a concussion, a substantial portion of our cohort who did not sustain concussions showed significant neurophysiological changes. Stepwise regression indicated significant relationships between the number of blows sustained by a subject and the ensuing neurophysiological change. Our findings reinforce the hypothesis that the effects of repetitive blows to the head are cumulative and that repeated exposure to subconcussive blows is connected to pathologically altered neurophysiology. "
2012-04-01,"High school football players are the single largest cohort of athletes playing tackle football, and account for the majority of sport-related concussions. Return to play guidelines (RTPs) have emerged as the preferred approach for addressing the problem of sport-related concussion in youth athletes. This article reviews evidence of the risks and effects of football-related concussion and subconcussive brain trauma, as well as the effectiveness of RTPs as a preventative measure. Literature review utilized PubMed and Google Scholar, using combinations of the search terms ""football,""sports,""concussion,""Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy,""athlete,""youth,"" and ""pediatric."" Literature review emphasized medical journals and primary neuroscientific research on sport-related concussion and concussion recovery, particularly in youth athletes. Sport-related concussion is a significant problem among student athletes. Student athletes are more vulnerable to concussion, and at risk of neurocognitive deficits lasting a year or more, with serious effects on academic and athletic performance. RTPs do little to address the problem of sport-related concussion or the chronic damage caused by subconcussive brain trauma. Emphasizing RTPs as the solution to the concussion problem in tackle football risks neglecting genuine reforms that would prevent concussions. More effective concussion prevention is needed. Eliminating tackling from school football for youth under 16 is recommended to reduce concussions. Additional modifications to football are recommended to enhance safety and reduce brain trauma at all levels of play. "

2012-03-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a form of neurodegeneration that results from repetitive brain trauma. Not surprisingly, CTE has been linked to participation in contact sports such as boxing, hockey and American football. In American football getting ""dinged"" equates to moments of dizziness, confusion, or grogginess that can follow a blow to the head. There are approximately 100,000 to 300,000 concussive episodes occurring in the game of American football alone each year. It is believed that repetitive brain trauma, with or possibly without symptomatic concussion, sets off a cascade of events that result in neurodegenerative changes highlighted by accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau and neuronal TAR DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43). Symptoms of CTE may begin years or decades later and include a progressive decline of memory, as well as depression, poor impulse control, suicidal behavior, and, eventually, dementia similar to Alzheimer's disease. In some individuals, CTE is also associated with motor neuron disease similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Given the millions of athletes participating in contact sports that involve repetitive brain trauma, CTE represents an important public health issue. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the etiology of CTE. It is now known that those instances of mild concussion or ""dings"" that we may have previously not noticed could very well be causing progressive neurodegenerative damage to a player's brain. In the future, focused and intensive study of the risk factors could potentially uncover methods to prevent and treat this disease.  "
2012-03-01,"While a history of a single traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with the later development of syndromes of cognitive impairment such as Alzheimer's disease, the long-term pathology evolving after single TBI is poorly understood. However, a progressive tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is described in selected cohorts with a history of repetitive concussive/mild head injury. Here, post-mortem brains from long-term survivors of just a single TBI (1-47 years survival; n=39) vs. uninjured, age-matched controls (n=47) were examined for neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques using immunohistochemistry and thioflavine-S staining. Detailed maps of findings permitted classification of pathology using semiquantitative scoring systems. NFTs were exceptionally rare in young, uninjured controls, yet were abundant and widely distributed in approximately one-third of TBI cases. In addition, Aβ-plaques were found in a greater density following TBI vs. controls. Moreover, thioflavine-S staining revealed that while all plaque-positive control cases displayed predominantly diffuse plaques, 64% of plaque-positive TBI cases displayed predominantly thioflavine-S-positive plaques or a mixed thioflavine-S-positive/diffuse pattern. These data demonstrate that widespread NFT and Aβ plaque pathologies are present in up to a third of patients following survival of a year or more from a single TBI. This suggests that a single TBI induces long-term neuropathological changes akin to those found in neurodegenerative disease. "
2012-11-01,"While the interneuronal propagation of neurofibrillary lesions in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies now appears to involve the spreading of tau-associated toxicity, little is known about its mechanism. We characterized the movement of human tau through the brain of a non-transgenic lower vertebrate tauopathy model in which full-length wild type and mutant human tau isoforms were expressed in identified neurons, thus permitting the identification and localization of EC tau sources. We describe two distinct patterns of tau spreading that correspond to tau species that lack (MTBR-) and contain (MTBR+) the tau microtubule-binding region. These patterns illustrate the production, migration and uptake of EC tau and resemble some of the extracellular tau deposits typically seen in human brain after repeated traumatic injury in cases of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We propose that misprocessed human tau can spread between CNS neurons via a variety of non-synaptic mechanisms as well as synaptically mediated mechanisms. "
2012-01-01,"The suggestion has been made that neurological changes seen in the syndrome of chronic traumatic encephalopathy may be due to exogenous anabolic steroid use rather than traumatic brain injury. To determine whether administration of anabolic steroids alters the pathophysiology of traumatic brain injury. Sixty adult male Sprague-Dawley rats and a linear acceleration model of traumatic brain injury were used. Experimental groups were (1) preinjury anabolic steroids, (2) preinjury placebo carrier, (3) anabolic steroids without injury, (4) no steroids and no injury, (5) postinjury placebo carrier, and (6) postinjury anabolic steroids. Following a 30-day recovery, rats were euthanized, and brainstem white matter tracts underwent fluorescent immunohistochemical processing and labeling of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), a marker of axonal injury. Digital imaging and statistical analyses were used to determine whether anabolic steroid administration resulted in a significant change in the number of injured axons. There was no statistically significant difference in number of APP-positive axons by immunohistochemical analysis between respective anabolic steroid and placebo groups. Using a standard acceleration-deceleration model of mild traumatic brain injury, we have shown successful visualization of traumatically injured axons with antibody staining of APP. Our results indicate no statistically significant effect of anabolic steroids on the number of APP-positive axons. With the use of this model, and within its limitations, we see no adverse effect or causative role of anabolic steroid administration on the brain following mild traumatic brain injury using APP counts as a marker for anatomic injury.

2012-01-01,"Thousands of boys and girls younger than 19 years of age participate in boxing in North America. Although boxing provides benefits for participants, including exercise, self-discipline and self-confidence, the sport of boxing encourages and rewards deliberate blows to the head and face. Participants in boxing are at risk of head, face and neck injuries, including chronic and even fatal neurological injuries. Concussions are one of the most common injuries occurring in boxing. Because of the risk of head and facial injuries, the Canadian Paediatric Society and the American Academy of Pediatrics vigorously oppose boxing as a sport for children and adolescents. These organizations recommend that physicians oppose boxing in youth and encourage patients to participate in alternative sports in which intentional head blows are not central to the sport. "
2012-04-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that is a long-term consequence of single or repetitive closed head injuries for which there is no treatment and no definitive pre-mortem diagnosis. It has been closely tied to athletes who participate in contact sports like boxing, American football, soccer, professional wrestling and hockey. Risk factors include head trauma, presence of ApoE3 or ApoE4 allele, military service, and old age. It is histologically identified by the presence of tau-immunoreactive NFTs and NTs with some cases having a TDP-43 proteinopathy or beta-amyloid plaques. It has an insidious clinical presentation that begins with cognitive and emotional disturbances and can progress to Parkinsonian symptoms. The exact mechanism for CTE has not been precisely defined however, research suggest it is due to an ongoing metabolic and immunologic cascade called immunoexcitiotoxicity. Prevention and education are currently the most compelling way to combat CTE and will be an emphasis of both physicians and athletes. Further research is needed to aid in pre-mortem diagnosis, therapies, and support for individuals and their families living with CTE. "
2011-12-01,"The pathologic phosphorylation and sub-cellular translocation of neuronal transactive response-DNA binding protein (TDP-43) was identified as the major disease protein in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) with ubiquitinated inclusions, now termed FTLD-TDP, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). More recently, TDP-43 proteinopathy has been reported in dementia pugilistica or chronic traumatic encephalopathy caused by repetitive traumatic brain injury (TBI). While a single TBI has been linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease and an increased frequency of neurofibrillary tangles, TDP-43 proteinopathy has not been examined with survival following a single TBI. Using immunohistochemistry specific for both pathological phosphorylated TDP-43 (p-TDP-43) and phosphorylation-independent TDP-43 (pi-TDP-43), we examined acute (n = 23: Survival < 2 weeks) and long-term (n = 39; 1-47 years survival) survivors of a single TBI versus age-matched controls (n = 47). Multiple regions were examined including the hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, cingulate gyrus, superior frontal gyrus and brainstem. No association was found between a history of single TBI and abnormally phosphorylated TDP-43 (p-TDP-43) inclusions. Specifically, just 3 of 62 TBI cases displayed p-TDP-43 pathology versus 2 of 47 control cases. However, while aggregates of p-TDP-43 were not increased acutely or long-term following TBI, immunoreactivity to phosphorylation-independent TDP-43 was commonly increased in the cytoplasm following TBI with both acute and long-term survival. Moreover, while single TBI can induce multiple long-term neurodegenerative changes, the absence of TDP-43 proteinopathy may indicate a fundamental difference in the processes induced following single TBI from those of repetitive TBI.

2011-12-01,"There are currently no consensus-based clinical diagnostic criteria for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). This review provides an update on recent literature pertaining to clinically relevant procedures that--presently or in the future--may be useful for the in-vivo detection, characterization, and/or prediction of CTE. Preliminary evidence about the clinical manifestations of CTE has been accumulating via post-mortem medical record review and interviews of friends or family members of individuals with neuropathologically documented CTE. This evidence suggests that CTE is manifested clinically by changes in cognition (especially memory and executive functioning, with dementia later in the disease course), mood (especially, depression, apathy, and suicidality), personality and behavior (especially poor impulse control and behavioral disinhibition), and movement (including parkinsonism and signs of motor neuron disease). At the present time, evidence regarding CTE has not been confirmed in a prospective study of a cohort at risk for CTE. On the basis of recent research in the fields of dementia and traumatic brain injury, several in-vivo procedures (including neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, neuroimaging techniques, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers) each have the potential to contribute unique information about the manifestations of CTE, including clinical and preclinical stages. More research is needed to develop a set of consensus diagnostic criteria that provide a reliable and valid indicator of neuropathologically verified CTE. Until such criteria are developed, the clinical assessment of CTE should be informed by modern research that is of relevance to traumatic brain injury and neurodegenerative diseases. "
2011-11-01,"Following his discovery of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in football players in 2002, Dr. Bennet Omalu hypothesized that posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans may belong to the CTE spectrum of diseases. The CTE surveillance at the Brain Injury Research Institute was therefore expanded to include deceased military veterans diagnosed with PTSD. The authors report the case of a 27-year-old United States Marine Corps (USMC) Iraqi war veteran, an amphibious assault vehicle crewman, who committed suicide by hanging after two deployments to Fallujah and Ramadi. He experienced combat and was exposed to mortar blasts and improvised explosive device blasts less than 50 m away. Following his second deployment he developed a progressive history of cognitive impairment, impaired memory, behavioral and mood disorders, and alcohol abuse. Neuropsychiatric assessment revealed a diagnosis of PTSD with hyperarousal (irritability and insomnia) and numbing. He committed suicide approximately 8 months after his honorable discharge from the USMC. His brain at autopsy appeared grossly unremarkable except for congestive brain swelling. There was no atrophy or remote focal traumatic brain injury such as contusional necrosis or hemorrhage. Histochemical and immunohistochemical brain tissue analysis revealed CTE changes comprising multifocal, neocortical, and subcortical neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads (ranging from none, to sparse, to frequent) with the skip phenomenon, accentuated in the depths of sulci and in the frontal cortex. The subcortical white matter showed mild rarefaction, sparse perivascular and neuropil infiltration by histiocytes, and mild fibrillary astrogliosis. Apolipoprotein E genotype was 3/4. The authors report this case as a sentinel case of CTE in an Iraqi war veteran diagnosed with PTSD to possibly stimulate new lines of thought and research in the possible pathoetiology and pathogenesis of PTSD in military veterans as part of the CTE spectrum of diseases, and as chronic sequelae and outcomes of repetitive traumatic brain injuries.

2011-11-01,"Each year in the United States, approximately 1.7 million people are diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury (TBI), about 75% of which are classified as mild TBIs or concussions. Although symptoms typically resolve in a matter of weeks, both children and adults may suffer from postconcussion syndrome for months or longer. A progressive tauopathy, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, is believed to stem from repeated brain trauma. Alzheimer-like dementia, Parkinsonism, and motor neuron disease are also associated with repetitive brain trauma. Effective diagnoses, treatments, and education plans are required to reduce the future burden and incidence of long-term effects of head injuries. "
2011-10-01,"Professional boxers and other contact sport athletes are exposed to repetitive brain trauma that may affect motor functions, cognitive performance, emotional regulation and social awareness. The term of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) was recently introduced to regroup a wide spectrum of symptoms such as cerebellar, pyramidal and extrapyramidal syndromes, impairments in orientation, memory, language, attention, information processing and frontal executive functions, as well as personality changes and behavioural and psychiatric symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging usually reveals hippocampal and vermis atrophy, a cavum septum pellucidum, signs of diffuse axonal injury, pituitary gland atrophy, dilated perivascular spaces and periventricular white matter disease. Given the partial overlapping of the clinical expression, epidemiology and pathogenesis of CTE and Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as the close association between traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and neurofibrillary tangle formation, a mixed pathology promoted by pathogenetic cascades resulting in either CTE or AD has been postulated. Molecular studies suggested that TBIs increase the neurotoxicity of the TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) that is a key pathological marker of ubiquitin-positive forms of frontotemporal dementia (FTLD-TDP) associated or not with motor neurone disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Similar patterns of immunoreactivity for TDP-43 in CTE, FTLD-TDP and ALS as well as epidemiological correlations support the presence of common pathogenetic mechanisms. The present review provides a critical update of the evolution of the concept of CTE with reference to its neuropathological definition together with an in-depth discussion of the differential diagnosis between this entity, AD and frontotemporal dementia. "
2011-10-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) has been linked to participation in contact sports such as boxing and American football. CTE results in a progressive decline of memory and cognition, as well as depression, suicidal behavior, poor impulse control, aggressiveness, parkinsonism, and, eventually, dementia. In some individuals, it is associated with motor neuron disease, referred to as chronic traumatic encephalomyelopathy, which appears clinically similar to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Results of neuropathologic research has shown that CTE may be more common in former contact sports athletes than previously believed. It is believed that repetitive brain trauma, with or possibly without symptomatic concussion, is responsible for neurodegenerative changes highlighted by accumulations of hyperphosphorylated tau and TDP-43 proteins. Given the millions of youth, high school, collegiate, and professional athletes participating in contact sports that involve repetitive brain trauma, as well as military personnel exposed to repeated brain trauma from blast and other injuries in the military, CTE represents an important public health issue. Focused and intensive study of the risk factors and in vivo diagnosis of CTE will potentially allow for methods to prevent and treat these diseases. Research also will provide policy makers with the scientific knowledge to make appropriate guidelines regarding the prevention and treatment of brain trauma in all levels of athletic involvement as well as the military theater.

2011-10-01,"It is estimated that between 1.6 and 3.8 million concussions occur annually in the United States. Although frequently regarded as benign, concussions can lead to multiple different adverse outcomes, including prolonged postconcussive symptoms, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, cognitive impairment, early onset dementia, movement disorders, psychiatric disorders, motor neuron disease, and even death. Therefore it is important to identify individuals with concussion to provide appropriate medical care and minimize adverse outcomes. Furthermore, it is important to identify individuals who are predisposed to sustaining a concussion or to having an adverse outcome after concussion. This article will discuss the current research on serum biomarkers for concussion, genetic influence on concussion, risk factors associated with concussion predisposition and poor outcome, and practical suggestions for the application of this information in clinical practice.

Incidence of concussion is presented in context of emergency room visits, as well as under-reporting of concussions. The literature on history of concussion is reviewed, for high school, collegiate, and professional athletes, with respect to potential long-term effects of cerebral concussion. Specific discussions of effects include: decreased cognition and increased symptom reporting following multiple concussions, and recent diagnoses of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in non-professional and youth athletes. Recent legislative and advocacy efforts are reviewed, including mandated programs in specific states. "
2011-07-01,"We define chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) as a progressive neurodegenerative syndrome caused by single, episodic, or repetitive blunt force impacts to the head and transfer of acceleration-deceleration forces to the brain. We present emerging histomorphologic phenotypes of CTE that we identified in our cohort of CTE cases with apolipoprotein E genotyping and causes and manners of death. Autopsy brain tissue of 14 professional athletes and 3 high school football players was examined after unexpected deaths. Histochemical and immunohistochemical tissue staining was performed with apolipoprotein E genotyping. Ten of 14 professional athletes (71%) were positive for CTE: 7 of 8 football players, 2 of 4 wrestlers, and 1 boxer. One of 3 high school players manifested incipient CTE. The age range of those with CTE was 18 to 52 years; they were all male athletes. In all cases of CTE, Alzheimer-type cerebral cortical atrophy was absent; negligible to mild neocortical neuronal dropout was present. The fundamental neuropathologic feature of CTE was the topographic distribution of sparse, moderate, and frequent band-shaped, flame-shaped, small and large globose neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads in the cerebral cortex, subcortical nuclei/basal ganglia, hippocampus, and brainstem nuclei. Sparse to frequent diffuse amyloid plaques may accompany tauopathy and was seen in only 2 CTE cases. No α-synucleinopathy was present. All 7 CTE-positive professional athletes with known apolipoprotein E genotypes had at least 1 E3 allele comprising 5 E3/E3 (71%) and 2 E3/E4 (29%). Alcohol- and drug-related deaths, suicides, and accidental deaths were overrepresented in our CTE cohort. The emerging histomorphologic features of our CTE cohort may specify histologic criteria for CTE diagnosis, may identify emerging histologic variants of CTE and may facilitate more objective surveillance and accurate identification of sentinel CTE cases. "
2011-02-01,"Axonally specific microtubule-associated protein tau is an important component of neurofibrillary tangles found in AD (Alzheimer's disease) and other tauopathy diseases such as CTE (chronic traumatic encephalopathy). Such tau aggregate is found to be hyperphosphorylated and often proteolytically fragmented. Similarly, tau is degraded following TBI (traumatic brain injury). In the present study, we examined the dual vulnerability of tau to calpain and caspase-3 under neurotoxic and neurodegenerative conditions. We first identified three novel calpain cleavage sites in rat tau (four-repeat isoform) as Ser130↓Lys131, Gly157↓Ala158 and Arg380↓Glu381. Fragment-specific antibodies to target the major calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K (35 kDa tau-breakdown product) and the caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K respectively were developed. In rat cerebrocortical cultures treated with excitotoxin [NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)], tau is significantly degraded into multiple fragments, including a dominant signal of calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K with minimal caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K. Following apoptosis-inducing EDTA treatment, tau was truncated only to TauBDP-48K/45K-exclusively by caspase. Cultures treated with another apoptosis inducer STS (staurosporine), dual fragmentation by calpain (TauBDP-35K) and caspase-3 (TauBDP-45K) was observed. Tau was also fragmented in injured rat cortex following TBI in vivo to BDPs of 45-42 kDa (minor), 35 kDa and 15 kDa, followed by TauBDP-25K. Calpain-mediated TauBDP-35K-specific antibody confirmed robust signals in the injured cortex, while caspase-mediated TauBDP-45K-specific antibody only detected faint signals. Furthermore, intravenous administration of a calpain-specific inhibitor SNJ-1945 strongly suppressed the TauBDP-35K formation. Taken together, these results suggest that tau protein is dually vulnerable to calpain and caspase-3 proteolysis under different neurotoxic and injury conditions. "
2011-02-01,The phenotypic expression of neuropsychological deficits can have very different genotypic etiologies. Understanding the causes of various neuropsychological deficits is tantamount in developing the appropriate treatments. The literature on mood disorders as a risk factor for dementia is reviewed as well as common neuropsychological patterns in dementia and mood disorders. A brief discussion on chronic traumatic encephalopathy is provided. 
2011-01-01,"Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a form of neurodegeneration believed to result from repeated head injuries. Originally termed dementia pugilistica because of its association with boxing, the neuropathology of CTE was first described by Corsellis in 1973 in a case series of 15 retired boxers. CTE has recently been found to occur after other causes of repeated head trauma, suggesting that any repeated blows to the head, such as those that occur in American football, hockey, soccer, professional wrestling, and physical abuse, can also lead to neurodegenerative changes. These changes often include cerebral atrophy, cavum septi pellucidi with fenestrations, shrinkage of the mammillary bodies, dense tau immunoreactive inclusions (neurofibrillary tangles, glial tangles, and neuropil neurites), and, in some cases, a TDP-43 proteinopathy. In association with these pathologic changes, disordered memory and executive functioning, behavioral and personality disturbances (eg, apathy, depression, irritability, impulsiveness, suicidality), parkinsonism, and, occasionally, motor neuron disease are seen in affected individuals. No formal clinical or pathologic diagnostic criteria for CTE currently exist, but the distinctive neuropathologic profile of the disorder lends promise for future research into its prevention, diagnosis, and treatment.

2011-07-01,"Some individuals suffering from mild traumatic brain injuries, especially repetitive mild concussions, are thought to develop a slowly progressive encephalopathy characterized by a number of the neuropathological elements shared with various neurodegenerative diseases. A central pathological mechanism explaining the development of progressive neurodegeneration in this subset of individuals has not been elucidated. Yet, a large number of studies indicate that a process called immunoexcitotoxicity may be playing a central role in many neurodegenerative diseases including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The term immunoexcitotoxicity was first coined by the lead author to explain the evolving pathological and neurodevelopmental changes in autism and the Gulf War Syndrome, but it can be applied to a number of neurodegenerative disorders. The interaction between immune receptors within the central nervous system (CNS) and excitatory glutamate receptors trigger a series of events, such as extensive reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species generation, accumulation of lipid peroxidation products, and prostaglandin activation, which then leads to dendritic retraction, synaptic injury, damage to microtubules, and mitochondrial suppression. In this paper, we discuss the mechanism of immunoexcitotoxicity and its link to each of the pathophysiological and neurochemical events previously described with CTE, with special emphasis on the observed accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau.

2010-12-01,"Patients who have sustained a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) from both civilian and military populations exhibit clinical symptoms of varying severity with minimal to profound impact on their daily functioning. Although most patients make a full recovery, a subgroup of mild TBI patients develop cognitive, somatic, and neurobehavioral sequelae that generally resolve over 3 to 6 months; a smaller subgroup develop persisting symptoms. The reason why a mild TBI results in varying clinical symptoms is currently unknown. Based on evidence that microRNA species in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) may reflect molecular alterations in neurodegenerative disorders, it can be hypothesized that at early, preclinical phases of the disease, PBMC may provide an ideal and clinically assessable ""window"" into the brain. Thus, it is conceivable that changes in the expression profile of clinically accessible biological indices (biomarkers), such as microRNA in PBMC, may reflect molecular alterations following TBI that contribute to the onset and progression of TBI phenotypes including chronic traumatic encephalopathy. It is possible that the availability of TBI biomarkers may provide potential elements with clinical relevance to prevention, prognosis, and treatment of postconcussive disorders. "
2013-11-01,"We present in this case report the tissue substrates and forensic evidence for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a professional American wrestler with Apolipoprotein E (apoE) genotyping. Professional wrestling is a contact-sport, with an integral risk for players to sustain repeated concussions over their careers. This case provides the first autopsy evidence of neuropathological abnormalities that accompany CTE in professional American wrestlers. A complete autopsy was performed on a 40-year-old Caucasian male, after he died unexpectedly by suicidal hanging after he had killed his wife and son. The brain showed no atrophy and no recent or remote contusions or necrosis. There was a mild to moderate neocortical neuronal dropout without any amyloid plaques. There were diffuse, sparse to frequent tau-immunoreactive Neurofibrillary Tangles and Neuropil Threads in the neocortex, subcortical ganglia, and brainstem nuclei including the substantia nigra consistent with CTE. The apoE genotype was determined to be E3/E3. Other autopsy findings included cardiomegaly, left ventricular hypertrophy, and bilateral atrioventricular dilatation; toxicologic analyses showed alprazolam and hydrocodone in the blood, and evidence of exogenous testosterone in the urine. Longitudinal studies of professional contact-sport athletes are needed to identify the differentiating characteristics of athletes who develop CTE and devise strategies for intervention. "
2010-09-01,"Epidemiological evidence suggests that the incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is increased in association with head injury. Repetitive head injury is also associated with the development of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a tauopathy characterized by neurofibrillary tangles throughout the brain in the relative absence of β-amyloid deposits. We examined 12 cases of CTE and, in 10, found a widespread TAR DNA-binding protein of approximately 43kd (TDP-43) proteinopathy affecting the frontal and temporal cortices, medial temporal lobe, basal ganglia, diencephalon, and brainstem. Three athletes with CTE also developed a progressive motor neuron disease with profound weakness, atrophy, spasticity, and fasciculations several years before death. In these 3 cases, there were abundant TDP-43-positive inclusions and neurites in the spinal cord in addition to tau neurofibrillary changes, motor neuron loss, and corticospinal tract degeneration. The TDP-43 proteinopathy associated with CTE is similar to that found in frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, in that widespread regions of the brain are affected. Akin to frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 inclusions, in some individuals with CTE, the TDP-43 proteinopathy extends to involve the spinal cord and is associated with motor neuron disease. This is the first pathological evidence that repetitive head trauma experienced in collision sports might be associated with the development of a motor neuron disease. "

2010-06-01,"Recently, it has become clear that head trauma can lead to a progressive neurodegeneration known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy. Although the medical literature also implicates head trauma as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, these findings are predominantly based on clinical diagnostic criteria that lack specificity. The dementia that follows head injuries or repetitive mild trauma may be caused by chronic traumatic encephalopathy, alone or in conjunction with other neurodegenerations (for example, Alzheimer's disease). Prospective longitudinal studies of head-injured individuals, with neuropathological verification, will not only improve understanding of head trauma as a risk factor for dementia but will also enhance treatment and prevention of a variety of neurodegenerative diseases.

2010-06-01,"We present 5 cases of professional American contact sport athletes who committed parasuicides and suicides aged 50, 45, 44, 36, and 40 years old. Full forensic autopsies and immunohistochemical analyses of the brains revealed chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The brains appeared grossly normal at autopsy without gross evidence of remote traumatic injuries or neurodegenerative disease. Brain immunohistochemical analyses revealed widespread cerebral taupathy in the form of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic threads without neuritic amyloid plaques. CTE refers to chronic cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms of chronic neurodegeneration following a single episode of severe traumatic brain injury or repeated episodes of mild traumatic brain injury. CTE can only be definitively diagnosed by direct tissue examination. Without full autopsies and immunohistochemical brain analyses these cases would never have been identified. Forensic pathologists will play a vital and central role in the emerging disease surveillance of CTE in professional American athletes, in the identification of CTE cases, and in the establishment of the epidemiology of CTE, with the goal of eventually developing preventive and interventional therapeutic protocols for CTE outcomes.

2010-05-01,"Assessment of visual fixation is commonly used in the clinical examination of patients with disorders of consciousness. However, different international guidelines seem to disagree whether fixation is compatible with the diagnosis of the vegetative state (i.e., represents ""automatic"" subcortical processing) or is a sufficient sign of consciousness and higher order cortical processing. We here studied cerebral metabolism in ten patients with chronic post-anoxic encephalopathy and 39 age-matched healthy controls. Five patients were in a vegetative state (without fixation) and five presented visual fixation but otherwise showed all criteria typical of the vegetative state. Patients were matched for age, etiology and time since insult and were followed by repeated Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) assessments for at least 1 year. Sustained visual fixation was considered as present when the eyes refixated a moving target for more than 2 seconds as defined by CRS-R criteria. Patients without fixation showed metabolic dysfunction in a widespread fronto-parietal cortical network (with only sparing of the brainstem and cerebellum) which was not different from the brain function seen in patients with visual fixation. Cortico-cortical functional connectivity with visual cortex showed no difference between both patient groups. Recovery rates did not differ between patients without or with fixation (none of the patients showed good outcome). Our findings suggest that sustained visual fixation in (non-traumatic) disorders of consciousness does not necessarily reflect consciousness and higher order cortical brain function. "
2013-05-01,"We present a case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a retired National Football League (NFL) Player with autopsy findings, apolipoprotein E genotype, and brain tissue evidence of chronic brain damage. This 44-year-old retired NFL player manifested a premortem history of cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairment, which included in part, chronic depression, suicide attempts, insomnia, paranoia, and impaired memory before he finally committed suicide. A full autopsy was performed with Polymerase Chain Reaction-based analyses of his blood to determine the apolipoprotein genotype. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were performed on topographical gross sections of the brain. Autopsy confirmed a fatal gunshot wound of the head. The apolipoprotein E genotype was E3/E3 and the brain tissue revealed diffuse cerebral taupathy (Neurofibrillary Tangles and Neuritic Threads). This will be the third case of CTE in a national football player, which has been reported in the medical literature. Omalu et al., reported the first two cases in 2005 and 2006. This case series manifested similar premortem history of neuropsychiatric impairment with autopsy evidence of cerebral taupathy without any neuritic amyloidopathy. For a definitive diagnosis of CTE to be made, and for medicolegal purposes, a full autopsy must be performed with histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses of the brain to identify the presence of Neurofibrillary Tangles (NFTs) and Neuritic Threads (NTs). Further longitudinal prospective studies are required to confirm the common denominators and epidemiology of CTE in professional American football players, which have been identified by this case series.

2010-01-01,"Seizures with or without trauma may cause fractures that occur commonly in epileptic seizures. Fracture risk is less reported in non-epileptic seizures. Some metabolic conditions leading to a decrease in bone mineral density may cause fractures secondary to non-epileptic seizure. We describe two cases of non-traumatic acetabular and vertebrae fractures following seizures without history of epilepsy. They occurred in two male patients, 18 and 48 years old suffering respectively from hypercorticism and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Seizures, occurring inside hospital, were secondary to hypertensive encephalopathy crisis with hypokaliemia in the first case and severe hypoglycaemia in the second one. Fracture was promoted by a decrease in mineral bone density caused respectively by hypercorticism and diabetic chronic renal failure. These observations emphasize that fracture prevention among patients with decreased mineral bone density should include the avoidance of metabolic causes of seizure. "

The mutual relations of traumatic and vascular processes are complex, the vascular pathogenetic features of a trauma influence actively to the brain, earlier damaged by an ischemic stroke, increasing the probability of the heavy form of a combined cerebral pathology and the unfavourable forecast. However the vascular encephalopathy in these conditions ""does not develop"" in posttraumatic one and chronic vascular-brain frustration absolutely prevail in all cases above traumatic ones. This fact is to be taken into consideration to further treatment and rehabilitation. "
2009-10-01,"Neuropathic pain that is the chronic, severe, and intractable pain, interferes with activities of daily living (ADL) and consequently reduces quality of life (QOL). We reported the efficacy of Yokukansan in patients with neuropathic pain, including acute herpetic pain, postherpetic neuralgia, central poststroke pain, post-traumatic spinal cord injury pain, thalamic syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome and symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia. Yokukansan was more effective compared with traditional medicines, such as tricyclic antidepressants, carbamazepine, gabapentin, and opioids etc., which are recommended to treat neuropathic pain. Recently, effects of Yokukansan is reported on the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in elderly patients with dementia. Repeated administration of Yokukansan decreases expression of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex in mice, and Yokukansan also protects destruction of myelin sheaths in rats with thiamine deficient-induced encephalopathy. Mechanism of effectiveness of Yokukansan on neuropathic pain has not been established; however, efficacy of Yokukansan on neuropathic pain has been shown clinically. As far as we know, this is the first report that Yokukansan was effective on neuropathic pain. Yokukansan without serious adverse reactions may be a possible medicine for treatment of neuropathic pain in future. "
2009-07-01,"Since the 1920s, it has been known that the repetitive brain trauma associated with boxing may produce a progressive neurological deterioration, originally termed dementia pugilistica, and more recently, chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). We review 48 cases of neuropathologically verified CTE recorded in the literature and document the detailed findings of CTE in 3 profession althletes, 1 football player and 2 boxers. Clinically, CTE is associated with memory disturbances, behavioral and personality changes, parkinsonism, and speech and gait abnormalities. Neuropathologically, CTE is characterized by atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres, medial temporal lobe, thalamus, mammillary bodies, and brainstem, with ventricular dilatation and a fenestrated cavum septum pellucidum. Microscopically, there are extensive tau-immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, astrocytic tangles, and spindle-shaped and threadlike neurites throughout the brain. The neurofibrillary degeneration of CTE is distinguished from other tauopathies by preferential involvement of the superficial cortical layers, irregular patchy distribution in the frontal and temporal cortices, propensity for sulcal depths, prominent perivascular, periventricular, and subpial distribution, and marked accumulation of tau-immunoreactive astrocytes. Deposition of beta-amyloid, most commonly as diffuse plaques, occurs in fewer than half the cases. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a neuropathologically distinct slowly progressive tauopathy with a clear environmental etiology. "
2009-05-01,"Subdural haemorrhage (SDH) in the infant has a different pattern from that seen in the older child and adult. It is usually a widespread, bilateral, thin film, unlike the thick, space-occupying and often unilateral clot seen in older children and adults after trauma. Whether both arise by the same mechanism is unknown, but it seems unlikely. Most SDH is said to be due to trauma but in infants there are other, atraumatic causes. Birth is also important; recent MRI studies show an incidence of almost 50% in asymptomatic neonates. Traumatic SDH is said to result from rupture of bridging veins but new insights into the anatomy of infant dura suggest a dural origin for thin film subdural bleeding in young babies. Acute SDH usually rapidly resolves, but sometimes develops into a chronic fluid collection. Healing of SDH is by formation of a granulating membrane which may confer vulnerability to rebleeding, either spontaneously or after an otherwise innocuous event. SDH has a particular significance as one of the features of the triad (together with retinal haemorrhage and encephalopathy) associated with non-accidental injury. As the possibility of non-accidental injury is often first raised by a radiologic report of subdural bleeding, it becomes critically important in the interpretation of the scan appearances to understand the unique physiology and anatomy of the infant dura.

2009-05-01,"Acquired brain injury (ABI) is a major public health problem due to its high incidence and prevalence, long-term effects on patients and their families and enormous socioeconomical costs. In our country, this is treated unequally by the different institutions and specialties. Its etiology, by order of incidence, is due to stroke, traumatic brain injury and anoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and then, at a great distance, a miscellaneous group in which hypoxic encephalopathy stands out. ABI has two extreme poles: deep coma and full reintegration into the community with a similar level as prior to the lesion. Between these poles are the vegetative states, minimally conscious states and, when there is minimal cognitive recovery, a varying range of difficult-to classify impairments, disabilities and handicaps, due to their extreme heterogeneity. The long-term outcome is assessed by descriptive and functional scales, which usually have important feasibility and validity problems. Some scales (GOS, GOSE) classify functional deterioration during the acute and subacute lesional phase. Others analyze neurorehabilitation planning and monitoring (ERLA, Barthel Index). The International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH-2) describes disabilities and impairments. The efficacy of rehabilitation treatment depends on the how early they are done, their adaptation to each patient's needs, intensity and performance by qualified rehabilitation centers. It is difficult to quantify their results in order to compare them because of the serious methodological difficulties. "
